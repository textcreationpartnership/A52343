            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Preſent thee here with a ſtranger whom I have put in an Engliſh veſt; and if thou deem him not worthy to be naturalizd, at leaſt, I pray entertain him civilly. When thou art throughly acquainted with him, &amp; haſt dived into a diſcovery of his perfections, thou wilt find rich pearles ſhrowded under a courſe ſhel; &amp; I am confident it wil never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thee, no more then me, of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. One that knowes how to diſtinguiſh fruit from leaves, &amp; pith from bark, a ſolid ſubſtance from a ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſhow, one that delights in truths, &amp; ſeeks rather his own ſpiritual advance, then a frothy feeding of his fancy, wil here find entertainment right for his purpoſe, that is, both ſubſtantial and delightful. He wil teach thee how to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve God in ſpirit &amp; truth, not by an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty ſound or canting uſe of theſe two words, as do our ſectaries, who when they have named them think all done, but by a real practiſe of Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb facs="tcp:39021:3"/> in the diſcharge of our incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent duty to God, our ſelves, and our neighbour.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak without metaphor, I offer thee a plain Tranſlation of a Latin treatiſe, a piece in high eſteem with me and many; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire only thy peruſal therof to make thee eſteem it ſo too. That which moved the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to compile it, moved me alſo to tranſlate it, yet with this difference, that he ſought only his own behoof, I my own, &amp; chiefly others. He a Parent of many ſuch iſſues, having la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourd long with his pen for the advance of his neighbour in the way of vertue, judgd it but meet to a make ſome proviſion for himſelf as a ſtore houſe of ſpiritual truths &amp; maximes, which he might have ready at every turn both for his meditation and practiſe. And I think he was much in the right, ſince charity begins at home, &amp; it availes very little to perfect others if we be ſtil truants our ſelves: ſelf-intereſt ought to be the firſt concern; nor are we to let our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſtarve at home while our endeavours are labouring to feed others abroad. This prudent ceconomy and ſage care of his own good is the common caſe of us all who have a ſoul to ſave; it being alſo our task to provide in the firſt place for its indemnity, that being the grand affair of our whole life, which if not done all is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly undone. And how can we provide better
<pb facs="tcp:39021:3"/> then by making uſe of his proviſions where the common exigence is the ſame? For by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctamen of charity it ſeldom happens, that one is ſo treacherous to himſelf as not to provide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the beſt: &amp; if what was beſt for him can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but good for us, what he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates without envy let us make uſe off with much freedom, little coſt, &amp; a harty welcome. There is not ſo much applauſe in tranſlating as writing, but the common benefit no whit the leſs, yea more; becauſe no man of judgment wil tranſlate what he deems not more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily good &amp; taking; but who can promiſe ſo much of his own conceptions amidſt ſo many miſcarriages &amp; abortions as daily happen?</p>
            <p>This our age &amp; kingdome is a little unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in this reſpect, that our beſt wits are forcd ſo to employ their pens for the defence of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick religion againſt the common adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and their aſſaults, as that they cannot fully attend to what is as neceſſary in its kind, the writing of ſpiritual treatiſes for the preſervation &amp; encreaſe of piety in the harts of the faithful. The former indeed is neceſſary, but is a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune it is ſo, upon ſuch a ſcore, or that among the children of the ſame Mother ſome ſhould be found ſo rebelliouſly bent; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with ſuch prejudice to the latter; this being the nurſery of devotion &amp; conſequently promoter of vertue and piety. Spiritual bookes
<pb facs="tcp:39021:4"/> are the ordinary tongue by which God ſpeakes to our ſoules, &amp; the conveyancers of his holy inſpirations when he is pleaſed to knock at the dore of our hart for entrance, yea the key which unlocks it. How many by reading them receive both light in their underſtanding &amp; love in their wil, not only to acknowledg but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what conduces to a vertuous life? How many have quit the filth of ſin in which they wallowed by wonderful converſions; &amp; how many more of better principles found therby effectual incentives to Chriſtian perfection. Certainly the benefits redounding thence are unſpeakable, &amp; great pitty it is that we are not better ſtored with ſuch books: for as our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite cannot feed long upon the ſame meat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being cloyed, though otherwiſe both whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome &amp; ſavory; no more can our underſtanding without a nauſeouſnes employ it ſelf in matter of reading, unles there be variety to ſeaſon it: I have heard even ſpiritual perſons bemoan their own &amp; the common ſcarcity in this kind. Beſides the excellency of the treatiſe it ſelf, this was a motive to me to contribute my mite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſome ſmal redreſs of the aggrievance.</p>
            <p>This premiſd, I muſt ſpeak a word or two of the Title it carryes, which is, <hi>Of Adoration in Spirit and Truth:</hi> the which he borrowes from the words of our B. Saviour to the Samaritan, &amp; is the ſubject of the whole work. In that confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb facs="tcp:39021:4"/> Io. 4. the great maſter <hi>Of Spirit &amp; Truth</hi> told her, the time would come when true ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers ſhould not be confined to Ieruſalem or the mountain in Samaria, but were to adore God in ſpirit &amp; Truth: for God being a ſpirit covets to be adord in ſpirit. Now what it is to adore him in <hi>Spirit</hi> &amp; <hi>Truth</hi> he explaines through the whole treatiſe, &amp; chiefly in the 4. firſt Chapters of the firſt Book, where he explicates what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands both by the one &amp; other, &amp; ſo clearly, that nothing needs to be ſuperadded. Only it wil not perchance be amiſs to forewarn ſome les skilful Reader, that he be not frighted into a prejudice of the Book by the title, it ſeeming to ſound ſomwhat of the Sectariſt, who hath nothing ſo frequent in is mouth, as I ſaid above, as <hi>Spirit &amp; Truth,</hi> &amp; nothing les in ſubſtance. The words indeed are eaſily named, and may ſerve for canting, among the ignorant; but if one go to the pith &amp; ſubſtance of ſpirit &amp; truth, as the Authour uſes them, to a true denial of our ſelves &amp; more then a lipp-love of God, here the ſectary wil be found as void of ſpirit as truth, &amp; in both a nut without a kernel. When the reader ſees the Authour to aym at nothing more then mortification, pennance, faſting, prayer, carrying our croſs, &amp; this through the courſe of our whole life, he wil ſoon diſcover him no ſectariſt, who dares ſcarſe ſo much as talk of theſe things, much les teach or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
<pb facs="tcp:39021:5"/> them, but a Roman Catholique, who alone owns them both in doctrin &amp; practiſe, as the chief meanes to Chriſtian perfection. Nor wil any body, think I, be ſo inconſiderately over-byaſſd, as to take any prejudice by theſe expreſſions, o infirm ſpirit, puſillanimous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which here and there he'l meet with. Tis true, by the abuſe of this our age; they ſound not ſo wel with us; through the default of thoſe who have renderd both them and themſelves ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; yet the words, like wine, are good enough, nor any more then that, for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtication or abuſe of ſome, to be miſlikd: conſider alſo that the Authour is a forraigner, with whom they carry no ſuch note; nor did I deem it neceſſary to change them.</p>
            <p>His induſtry in the compilement of this work ſeems by his own confeſſion to have been very extraordinary; he not ſticking to aver that it was the fruit of all his labours &amp; the hony-comb of al his ſtudious endeavours while bee-like he ſuckd from each H. Father &amp; Maſter of Spirit; as from ſo many delicious flowers, what he found in them rare and exquiſite? with theſe truths &amp; maximes as with ſo many pretious ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he has paved the way to perfection, digeſting them into that triple path, which according to its great maſters leads therto, to wit purgative, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminative, unitive, in the firſt, after he has told us what it is to adore God in ſpirit &amp; truth
<pb facs="tcp:39021:5"/> without eyther fanaticiſme or duplicity, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves us the lively reſentments of a penitent hart, while it rock-like, ſtruck with the rod of the croſs, diſſolves into the waters of a profound compunction. Amidſt its ſighs and teares he conducts us on towards the ſecond by true fruits of pennance, love of God, contempt of the world, through all the oppoſitions of ſelf love worldly concerns &amp; contrary temptations. By degrees he leads us out of the deſert of ſin into the land of promiſe and the darknes of Aegypt into the fair ſun ſhine of divine grace, and here that light offers himſelf for guid which illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates every man coming into this world, &amp; we know that who ever followes him walks not in darknes. For what doth this path aym at but a perfect imitation of his life by a conſtant tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe ſacred footſteps of vertu which he left deeply imprinted by ſelf-abnegation, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, patience, meeknes, poverty, perſecution &amp; all thoſe which compleat a totall fulfilling of Chriſtian juſtice &amp; perfection.</p>
            <p>That this may be the better accompliſhd, he ſpends no les then a whole book (to wit the 3.) in teaching us how to diſcharg our duty in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the aforeſaid imitation by a moſt perfect practical performance of our daily actions. And not without good reaſon ſince the whole is but the reſult of all particulars, which if perfect, the other can ſcarſe ſuffer any allay: he that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
<pb facs="tcp:39021:6"/> his daily actions perfectly, treads a ſure path to perfection; &amp; whoſoever aymes at it without this medium ſhoots at random like a blind archer. All theſe are works of light, &amp; this according to the Philoſopher, being productive of heat, they diſpoſe wonderfully to the 3. path which leads a ſoul thus affected to a ſtrait union, the true lovers knot, with almighty God. And whether ſhould ſuch a bird of Paradiſe, ſo diſdaigning earth, ſo enamoured on heaven, ſo wingd with charity &amp; fitted for the flight ſoare, but up to the boſome of God himſelf where neſtling as in its center, it may ſay with H. Iob, <hi>in nidulo meo moriar.</hi> This is the laſt complement of a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul in this life, the purchaſe of its labours and fruition of deſires; where its activity becomes paſſive, and its task with little Samuel is only to ſay <hi>Loquere Domine quia audit ſervus tuus;</hi> nor yet can it be ſaid to be idle. For he teaches not a lazy love but operative and maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, a love that loves to be in the ſun and duſt, bearing the heat and weight of the day in carrying its croſs, and yet wel

            <p>And in this ſpiritual journey which certainly tends to a <hi>Vade in pace</hi> and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to that peace of God which paſſes all underſtanding, directs the traveller not through any extraordinary paths, or by new and uncouth lights, but teaches him to take the roadway of the croſs in the broad daylight therof, following him who ſaid, I am the way; and this by a profound contempt of himſelf as wel as all the things of this world, by an entyre mortification of his paſsions, ſubduement of his wil to the wil of God, by a curbing of his appetites, maſtry over ſelf love, command over ſenſe and much more over ſenſuality; and by ſuch ſteps (the trueſt ſteps of love, and to it,) aſsiſted by a daily recognition of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine benefits towards man, ſo unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelld and ineſtimable, he leads him up the mount of perfection. Which jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney though it be not performd without great extente of time, labour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, yet having once ſurmounted the difficulty and its top, rayſd now
<pb facs="tcp:39021:7"/> above all wind and weather, in what a peaceful calme doth he find himſelf! few believe this beſides thoſe that experience it, and therfore it is but loſt labour to inſiſt upon it; yet I dare ſay its joyful contentivenes exceeds the guſt of the moſt affecting pleaſures the world affords. But theſe are onely the entertainments of choyſe ſoules, the perfect; I can ſay to the comfort of all, that the work it ſelf affords both effectual helps to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and a certaine redreſs for ſpiritual maladies in what kind ſoever they be. For the peruſer will diſcover in it a rich mine of heavenly treaſures, a new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſatory of celeſtial recepts, antidotes againſt all the poyſons of ſin, and an Armory of defence to ſhield him from the aſſaulting enemy. Which though it was writ for himſelf, a Religious man, and by its ſublimity may ſeeme proper for that ſtate; yet it is of that latitude &amp; capacity, that even ſeculars, if they be but vertuouſly diſpoſd to the ſervice of God, may plentifully reap benefit by it, nor would I wiſh any body upon this ſcore to harbour a prejudice againſt it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:39021:7"/>
            <p> Thus much being ſayd of the matter &amp; weightynes of his diſcourſe, I muſt now in a word touch alſo the manner. His way of arguing is ſolid and witty but he has no regard at all to evennes of ſtile or quaintnes of expreſsion, ſpeaking as we ſay a la negligence as to both like one that ſtudy's more what to ſay then how: and this it ſeems he doth on ſet purpoſe. For in his Epiſtle Dedicatory (which I omit as needles) he gives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it: <q>I write this memorial ſayth he, in a plain ſtile and without any ornament of ſpeech, ſince the word of God (not unlike a ſword) the more naked it is the more deeply it pierceth, much deeper then if it were ſheathd in the richeſt phraſes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane eloquence: and it is the ſincerity of the ſpeaker, not the gorgeous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire of Rhetorique which makes it majeſtical. I aymd, ſayth he, at the ſelf ſame in this Treatiſe which the zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Biſhop Salvianus mentions in his Epiſtle to Salonius:</q> 
               <hi>We who love deeds better then words,</hi> ſaith this holy Prelate <hi>ſeek rather after profit then applauſe; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:39021:8"/> 
               <hi>do we labour ſo much that the vayn pomp of the world be prayſed in us, as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſubſtantial matter; in our writings we covet not to ſet forth a fine dreſs but to give redreſs.</hi> 
               <q>This was the reaſon, (ſayth my Authour) why I was not curious at all about the ſtile, which I thought was not to be uniforme, but attemperd to the nature of the ſubject it treated of, for a pious and ſincere matter is to be handled without all pompousnes and Oratorical figures; and I preparing it for my ſelf, ſlender ornament would ſerve the turn.</q> Thus much he: and all this I have inſerted, as pertinent to teach my Reader how little regardable theſe things are, where ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and truth ſway the ballance, the hart being not touched but the fancy onely tickled with ſuch vanities. What no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious reader will condemne in him, will not I hope be miſlikd in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatour, ſo far, as wauing all matter of ſtile, he attends to the engliſhing of the Authours ſenſe, yea words, in as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per phraſe and expreſsion as he can, he being a Tranſlatour not a Paraphraſt.
<pb facs="tcp:39021:8"/> Which how farr he hath attaind, muſt be left to the readers verdict; and that, be what it will, he ſtands not much upon, if the fruit he aymes at be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in his ſoule, following, in ſuch a fair view of truth as it expreſſeth, her footſteps to a ſincere Adoration in <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> miſled, no more by the world and its impoſtures.</p>

Ghoſt hates diſſimulation in matter of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline. An impoſture is ſo much more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, by how much the affair in which it is uſed, is of greater concern and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Men deem nothing dearer then life; how then can they endure to be deluded in it: how can they brook forgery in matters of Spirit and worſhip of God, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly to be prizd above life it ſelf. An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture concerning life is the worſt of evils. It is too dangerous and formidable to be ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a thing of all others the moſt important and pretious. Men ſuffer not willingly their eyes to be cheated; and how ill do they man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their buſines, if they ſuffer their minds? They fret and chafe if they be cozend in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:39021:10"/> ſtones, and how much more ought they concerning themſelves? How careful and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant are thoſe that traffique in gems leaſt a counterfeyt be put into their hands inſteed of a true one: no man will buy a jewel, unles the ſeller give both oath and ſuerty, that it is not adulterous. This is the madnes of men; they are content to ſet a falſe rate upon their life though not upon a ſtone; they love not to be deceived in their eye-ſight, but can diſgeſt a greater fallacy in their mind, in their life, yea and in their heaven.</p>
                  <p>We take it very ill to be cheated by another though but in ſmal trifles, and we willingly cheat our ſelves even in the price of our ſelves. We love neither to hear nor tel a lye; and yet we make both our ſelves and our life a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual lye. O miſerable! who are both the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and deceivers of our ſelves; and we bear this two fold miſery, which men ſo much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor, with patience, and we tolerate this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble infamy in a buſines of ſuch conſequence, whereas we ſhould brook neither in a trivial one. If thou judge it a heynous crime to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy friend, and holds it the greateſt of wrongs to be deceived by thy friend; what ground or pretenſe in the world canſt thou have to cozen thy ſelf or be cozend by thy ſelf who ſhouldſt be dearer and faithfuller to thy ſelf then any friend whatſoever. But we willingly entitle our loſſes through our own default (which nevertheles are the heavyeſt and in a double kind) with the fair name of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39021:10"/> and animate our ſelves to our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by not only holding our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of blame, but worthy of Congratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The covetous man would take it ill if one ſhould cozen him in the fading goods of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: he would deem it an intolerable injury if one ſhould ſtuf his Coffers and bags with dirt or rubbage in lieu of gold or ſilver; and why doe we not onely endure but even affect to be cozend by our ſelves in the goods of vertue and grace; nor grieve that our life is ſoyld with the ſtaines of vices and defects; or that our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is hypocritical, our charity but forged, our mortification ſuperficial, our humility co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unterfeyt.</p>
                  <p>A main reaſon of this endammagement is, becauſe we doe not purſue or rather throughly perſecute ſelf love lurking in us, and put not this domeſtique enemy to the ſword. It's no charity to ſave the life of an enemy to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice or endangering of our own by giuing ear to his pernicious counſels. We harken to our appetits as to ſo many Oracles, although they utter nothing but lyes. He that lends his ear to ſoothing flatterers muſt needs give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to many things that are falſe, and he that attends to the fawning charmes of ſelf love ſhall ever and anon be deceived.</p>
                  <p>Tell me, o my ſoul, if a court or Senate of wiſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcientious men ſhould all with joynt conſent determine a cauſe, and the malefactour alone, pleading nevertheles guilty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by witneſſes, one as fooliſhly fond as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39021:11"/> deſperately wicked, ſhould ſtand out againſt the verdict of the whole Court as unjuſt and partial; wouldſt thou believe this one wretch rather then ſo many wiſe and upright Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours? Why then doſt thou follow the toyes and fancies of ſelf love and its brutiſh appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites? how dareſt thou oppoſe its verdict alone to that of God, of his Angels, of the Doctours of the Church, of ancient Philoſophers, of reaſon it ſelf, nay even of thy own conſcience all theſe condemning for naughty what it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves for good, yea condemning its very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctamens and defires. Perſwade thy ſelf that that is falſe which God holds not for true, which the Angels diſapprove, which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours impugne, Philoſophers refute, reaſon diſallows, nor ſquares with Conſcience. All theſe find this ſelf love, this crafty fox ful of wiles, guilty of forgery. We are ful of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyt becauſe ful of ſelf love; and ſo much the more perniciouſly ful by how much it is not onely a domeſtique cheat but ſo linkd to us, yea ſo engrafted in us that it never leaves us, nor gives us the leaſt reſpit from errour. Hence not onely cuſtome but even preſcription in cozenage hath ſo hardend us, that what is done viciouſly, we maintain many times as done very prudently, yea and according to goſpel, and ſeek to ſanctify by the doctrine of Chriſt, what is clearly repugnant to reaſon. The miſt of ignorance which man walks in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him ſufficiently miſerable, he needs not be miſſed with forgery: yet ignorance is but a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39021:11"/> petty and inconſiderable miſery, its darknes being eaſily diſpeld as ſoon as the light of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhines; but the night of errour is ſo wilfully and pertinaciouſly blind that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being illuminated with any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. O, it were hartily to be wiſhd we were onely ignorant and not ſeduced alſo!</p>
                  <p>This folly and impoſture of worldlings rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes in a manner among all ſorts and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them. Let them account themſelves never ſo wiſe, let them be the prime Doctours and profeſſours of Vniverſities, they are idiots and ill-maximd, and unworthy of ſuch titles, unles they be good and vertuous. Pick out any one of theſe, ſuch as all the world holds for an Oracle of knowledg; if thou ſhouldſt but once ſee this man voyd his curious cupbords and cabinets of jewells and veſſels of gold, and throw away pearles and pretious ſtones to fill them up with dirt and dung, couldſt thou perſwade thy ſelf, that this were a wiſe man who ſo prizeth the latter and miſprizeth the former? And how then ſhall he be accounted wiſe, who not once but allwayes is ſtuffing his hart with aſpirements to honours with deſires of riches and pleaſures, and contemns the love of God, the treaſures of divine grace, the merits of Chriſt, yea God himſelf? All which incomparably more ſurpaſs worldly honours, treaſures, pleaſures, then gold doth dirt, as much to wit, as God the Creatour ſurmounts his creature. What imports it if thou ſayeſt, that this proceeds not from his ignorance in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39021:12"/> undervaluing things, but that this man knew well enough the difference betwixt ſpiritual things and temporal, a thing which no body can doubt of though his proceedings be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? what, I ſay wil this avail; for nether wil he be excuſed from madnes, who ſhould ſay that he knowes wel enough the value of gold above other things and how baſe dirt is in compariſon of it; yet nevertheles keeps dirt, courts it, embraces it, kiſſes it, yea and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth no danger nor labour in ſearch of it; but if gold be tenderd him he throwes it away and daigns it not ſo much as a look. Certainly this hidden madnes and viſible darknes is far more to be admired; and thou darſt not call ſuch a one a wiſe man, or well in his wits leaſt thou ſhould be houted at by all having loſt thine owne. How much more will he expoſe himſelf to the cenſure both of laughter and madnes, who profeſſing that the ſpiritual trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of grace are much to be preferd before all the goods of this world, covets nevertheles the latter and rejects the former. Could he be accounted a learned man or ſound in judgment or a good Chriſtian, who ſhould caſt the B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Chriſts holy Body out of a golden Ciborium conſecrated to its conſervation, and place there inſteed of it a piece of clay? And how deſerves he the name of a wiſe man who expels the Divinity it ſelf out of his ſoule, where it took complacence to reſide as in its ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and ſets up in its place not dung but more filthy vices and ſordid deſires, as the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39021:12"/> idols of his licentious devotions? Therfore we muſt conclude that there is no wiſdome no truth to be found in a worldly life. The dread fulleſt inſtruments of revenge which Chriſt ſhall make uſe of to puniſh the ſenſles in the day of judgment, ſhall not be the conflict of confounded elements, nor the fall of the ſtars, nor the eclipſe of the ſun, nor the conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, nor the frightful voice of the Archangel, nor that ſhrilſounding trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of God, nor the countenance of the angry judge, but truth alone: Truth, I ſay, which ſhall then be rendred illuſtrious to all, though now as it is veyld with our naughty deſires we contemne it.</p>
                  <p>But although truth be certainly found in a ſpiritual life, yet not altogether refined from the dregs of forgery; both by reaſon of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therfore Chriſt our Saviour recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to us as the glory of Euangelical perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that we adore God in ſpirit and truth. The true God ought not to be worſhipped with a falſe life. The onely begotten Son of God is truth, and he that will be the Son of God muſt love truth and poſſeſs himſelf of it. Wherfore whoſoever evading the precipices of the fleſh, treads now the plaine paths of ſpirit, let him not hold himſelf altogether out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerunles
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:39021:13"/> he walk the roadway of truth. And to the end thou mayſt follow this more ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, take theſe admonitions which will teach thee to adore God, and ſerve him unfaignedly in uprightnes of hart; and make thee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what truth ſpeaks, leaſt ſome deceit mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlead thy ſpirit: but rather doing truth in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we may increaſe in Chriſt by all our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider but the cauſes of this their averſion, and thou ſhalt ſee that they render it much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable. Of all croſſes and afflictions truth ſeemes the moſt harſh and burdenſome: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe particular afflictions impugne either one onely pleaſure or at leaſt but ſome few, but truth fights them all together, and proclames warr at once againſt all other kind of vices. Therfore they hold it the ſaddeſt adverſary they have; and for the ſame reaſon think they can revenge themſelves no wayes more upon their enemys nor ſting them more picquantly then by ſpeaking truth to their diſadvantage: the reaſon is, becauſe what harme ſoever one moſt dreads to himſelf, his paſſion makes him wiſh the ſame to his enemy; and becauſe he dreads no kind of evil more then truth, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tels all he knowes to his adverſarys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39021:14"/> and ſeeks thus to wound him as with ſo many poyſonous darts. But theſe cauſes of offence are arguments which ought to heighten our love and eſteem of truth: is not that worthy of all love which hath all vice in ſuch hatred and deteſtation? If thou hadſt one po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which would cure thee of all diſeaſes, thou wouldſt not contemne it for being bitter and diſtaſtfull, nay thou wouldſt prize nothing more highly: ſo truth upon that ſame ſcore is to be loved and adored, although it be even nayld to a croſs, though voyd of beauty and unhandſome.

It hath God for its ſeaſoning it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury, or diſguſtfull, or tainting. That which makes God happy muſt not be noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, neither can it make thee miſerable. What ſhall I ſay? God is truth, and can he be either more diſtaſtfull to thee then gal, or not more lovely then light? Go to then take the courage to look it in the face, to affect it, to put thy ſelf under its tuition and patronage. This is the main maxime of a ſpiritual life, that as carnal people hate nothing more then truth, ſo thoſe that walk the paths of ſpirit have nothing in higher eſteem or deſire. What is more dear or uſeful to an archer then his eyes; and what ought to be more deſirable to a reaſonable man then truth which is the eye of his ſoule. Archers and other creatures alſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39021:14"/> made for the behoof of man, if they want their eyes become altogether unſerviceable; ſo our whole life without truth proves but a fruitles buſines.

Theſe people deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for this is not the ſpirit of truth. This ſpirit is a moſt ſimple and tranſparent thing; and therfore that will not be true and genuine which is ſo confounded and intoxicated. The fleſh and the ſpirit are two things ſo different,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39021:15"/> that they cannot be combind into one ſimple. The ſpirit of truth ought to be ſo refind and ſincere, that it is not enough to dread and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor all the faigned ſoothings of the fleſh, all the pernicious dictamens of worldlings, and the forcibleſt inſinuations of ſelf love, but one muſt moreover diſpoil ones ſelf of himſelf and his own ſoul, and renounce totally his own will and all created contentments, yea even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual and otherwiſe lawful, to ſeek God alone and in him poſſeſs all things.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirit is ſomewhat more ſublime and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>find then is the ſoul, the underſtanding, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Hear thy Ieſus ſaying, God is a ſpirit and thoſe that adore him muſt do it in ſpirit and truth.

                  <p>Thou muſt be eternally divorced from all things, and thou mayſt be ſo, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger to thy ſelf, yea without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But if thou deſire to renounce all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure renounce thy own will, even in the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt things, even in things juſt and lawfull. Beware leaſt if thou be found with the cloak of ſelf will, the domineering fleſh which makes uſe of all advantages, catch hold of its skirts as the Aegyptian lady did of Ioſephs, that is to ſay, of thy appetites ſo linkt with thy will,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39021:17"/> and ſollicite thee to play the naught. The very skirts are hold enough wherby to draw thee to ſuch a fact: great over throwes are occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond by petty neglects: unles thou wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe thy ſelf and walk naked, thou wilt not be altogether void of danger. Diſpoyle thy ſelf I ſay intirely of thy own will, doe not wear thy own undoing, doe not cloath thy ſelf with danger of thy ſelf. When Elias was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed up to heaven, he left his cloak behind him; and each one that betakes himſelf to a heavenly life if he will doe it ſecurely muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh his own wil. Quit all ſelf-intereſt and ſelf delight, quit thy ſelf of thy ſelf in all things: having broken the greater cords which manicled thee, why wilt thou indure the leſſer with ſuch an abridgment to the liberty of thy ſpirit. A maſtif thats tyd up is not at free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome becauſe his chain is ſo long that he can frisk and play a little to and fro. It fares with the moſt part not much otherwiſe then with a ſparrow which a child holds by a thred at its foot; which being let of his hand, thinks it ſelf free and flyes cheerfully the length of the thread but then being checkt it falls to the ground and finds it ſelf ſtill captive: ſo a ſoul remaines as it were with a thred at its foot if it doe not totally quit all, and thinking it ſelf at liberty after ſome time it will diſgracefully fall into the filth or pudle of ſome groſs imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.

                  <p>But perchance thou wilt yet hold it very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable to be wholy deprived of thy own wil and pleaſure. What if I ſhould tell thee that it is not inſupportable even to wiſh for ſorrow and ſuffering? for it will not ſeem bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome to be deprived of all pleaſure, if the privation it ſelf be pleaſant and delectable: The vigour of the ſpirit reacheth to this, the inuentivenes of grace can bring it to paſs, rendring all guſtfull relliſhes ſo diſtaſtfull that all ſweet things become unſauory and faſtidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and bitter on the contrary, delicious and toothſome. Nature many times effects, that what is harſh to one is guſtfull to another, and will grace be leſs operative? The long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of women make them couet ridiculous extravagancies, coales, clay, mortar, and to loth meats exquiſitely ſeaſond: and that which happens ſo obviouſly to a womaniſh indiſpoſition, ſhal it be thought impoſſible to divine healthfulnes? A corrupt and queaſy ſtomack rules the appetite, and ſhal a ſound and maſculine mind have leſs or no ſway over the wil?

                  <p>HE walks in falſhood and forgery not in truth nor ſpirit who takes not faith for his path and guide. Truth dwels
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:39021:19"/> very remote from ſenſe, This heavenly flower growes not in our gardens; it is not nouriſhed with fleſh and blood; it is not to be found am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idſt the dung of our muddy and material ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. We are at al turnes cheated in corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goods even thoſe which we behold with our eyes and fingar with our hands. A whole oare in the water ſeems broken; a ſquare tower to one that ſtands at a great diſtance ſeems ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und: the very light of the ſun, which is al the faith our eyes are endowd with, cozens them oftentimes by repreſenting colours that are not exiſtent: and how then ſhal we avoid being miſled in the affaires of our ſoul which we ſee not, and in ſpiritual and divine things which are ſo much above our reach and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. All the race of mankind was grown quite blind through the night of errour; like one ſhut up in a dark dungeon without either window or chink to let in the leaſt glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of light. The learneder ſort of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers were of opinion we knew no more, then what we knew was falſe: or rather that we knew only this one truth, that we knew nothing at all; and they were ſo ſwoln and puffd up with vanity that none but heaven could give an allaying remedy. One among them did think that the maſter of truth was to be ſome Son of a God: Behold now, o thou Son of the higheſt, o thou eternal Truth, behold o thou wiſdome of thy father, thou didſt deſcend from heaven, o light of the world, to illuminate it, to teach us truth;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39021:19"/> and why do not men make more account of ſo great a benefit, why doe they contemne this bleſſing of faith? What imports it to believe truth if we our ſelves practiſe falſhood? ſaving truth is good works, and the true word the deed of the word. The word of God became fleſh that the work of man might become truth, becauſe the Truth of God is become operative.</p>
                  <p>All is mere falſhood and vanity which is not according to the doctrine of IESVS: why doe we neglect the practiſe of this great bleſſing, contenting our ſelves with a dead kind of faith? We ſhould reap great advantage from our faith if we knew how to uſe it, and work as we ought according to its preſcript, greater then if we beheld thoſe things it affirmes with our eyes. All by faith believe true things, but they ought alſo to believe truly which all ſeem not to do. If thou believe, o malepert ſoul, what Chriſt taught, work accordingly. If it be true that it behooud IESVS to ſuffer, and ſo to enter into his glory; if it be true that God ordaines all for the good of the juſt, why art thou afflicted at ſome trivial croſſes and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities? Why doſt thou account them loſſes, which when they are patiently taken, faith teacheth us to be the ſoules greateſt enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If thou believe this to be true as in very truth it is, thou oughteſt rather to rejoyce and comfort thy ſelf. If thou ſhouldſt behold ſome one of the H. Prophets with thy corporal eyes as David or S. Iohn Baptiſt, if thou ſhouldſt ſee
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39021:20"/> one raiſed from death, or an Angel from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who were to tell thee from Almighty God, that his will is, that thou beare this croſs patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it will be for thy greater good and no little gain: would it not ſuffice to make thee refrain from all impatience? nay would it not repleniſh thee with ſuch joy as ſiezd the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, when they went away rejoycing becauſe they were made worthy to ſuffer reproaches for the name of IESVS? And why doſt thou not now do the ſame? Thou oughteſt not to eſteem that miraculous meſſage as infallible as a matter of faith: for in that caſe one might lawfully ſomtimes entertain a doubt, ſince the evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit might delude him or he himſelf be deluded in his ſenſes. Therfore if this truth as matter of faith be more certain, then if an Angel had teveald it from heaven, why ought it to be leſs perſwaſive? Our manner of working followes the certitude of our knowledg and the judgment we frame of a thing; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to this knowledg muſt needs be the excellency of our operation. Wherfore whoſoever deſires to walk in truth let him ſquare the actions, and paths of his life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the model of his faith, believing not onely true things but after a true manner: leaſt he become ridiculous to the Angels and joynt-ſectary with the Divels who are all ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidians, their beliefe being barren of works.</p>
                  <p>What availes it to know the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if we doe not walk it. The wicked ſpirits know it better then we, and nevertheles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39021:20"/> they ſtand ſtil and advance not, they are divels. Tel me, who is in a better condition, thou that wilt not doe good or the divels that cannot. It is all one in moſt things not to have a will and to be impotent; yea it is more damnable and reproachful to thee who wilt not when thou mayſt. The divels believe and tremble; I wiſh thou when thou believeſt, wert poſſeſsd with a juſt fear. Why doſt thou not tremble at the judgments of God conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their certainty and the uncertainty of thy own condition either to eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or joy? what is the reaſon if we believe the greatnes of the divine goodnes in it ſelf, and his immenſe charity and ineſtimable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits towards us, what is the reaſon, I ſay, that we doe not correſpond in love, fidelity, and obſervance? but rather dare offend him though but venialy, and do not worſhip and love him indefatigably with all the extent of our ſtrength, who employd all the force of his omnipotency in creating and conſerving us, and loves us both perfectly and eternally, and loves us even to the end, yea even unto death? what is the reaſon that we are alwayes ſenſeles to our own good, and ſhameles towards his majeſty whether we believe or believe not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, while we remain ſo ſenſleſly benumd? If we have not a firm beliefe, what greater fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſince men give credit in all things to flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, becauſe they ſpeak according to their pallat and profit, then to disbelieve matters of faith ſo much importing us to be ſo, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:39021:21"/> redounding ſo much to our credit and profit, that they be true and undoubted? What greater irreverence then to believe a man, all men being obnoxious to lying and deceit, and not believe God ſpeaking things profitable to us, and atteſting them by ſo many miracles? But if we believe theſe things and belye them with our actions; what greater abſurdity and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God then to reject his moſt amiable goodnes, contemn his love, his blood, his benefits, and either not dread the paines of Purgatory and hell, or not hope for and moſt ardently deſire the glory of heaven, which God eſteems matters of high concernment, and as ſuch eggs us on both by threats and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to good works. What greater madnes then to expoſe our ſelves by our own negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the hazard of forfeiting eternal glory, or at leaſtwiſe enduring a long Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>We muſt be ſure to make our works ſquare in all exactly with our beliefe and adhere more tenaciouſly, then if thoſe objects were patent to the eye or any other ſenſe or experiment. Thou haſt received the ſacred body of Chriſt, or art preſent at the dreadful Sacrifice of the Maſſe, if thou believe that Chriſt is really there preſent with thee, thou oughſt to behave thy ſelf with greater ſubmiſſion and veneration, then if thou didſt clearly behold him with thy eyes, and to pray to him with a livelier confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, then if the heavens were opend to thee as they were to S. Stephen, and thou beheldſt the Hierachies of Angels accompanying Chriſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:39021:21"/> coming to thee to receive thy petitions: for thou mayſt be more infallibly ascertaind by faith that he is upon the Altar, then if thou didſt ſee him with thy corporal eyes. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one procure after this manner to penetrate the truths of divine faith, and ſtrengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in their certainty, making his works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to his beliefe. But how doſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed conſequently and not rather cozen thy ſelf when thou ſayſt thou eſteemſt the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of glory more then the empyre of the whole world; and nevertheles to gain heaven thou wilt not deny thy ſelf the leaſt pleaſure; and art ſo be ſotted upon temporal things, that thou toyleſt and moyleſt without reſpit for their purchaſe.

                  <p>What pretence can man alledge why he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes his converſion and adheres not to God with all his forces? Is it becauſe he is inſenſible of the evil it being not patent to the eye? but now we are taught it by faith which is more certaine then our eyeſight. Or becauſe our nature is infirme and prone to vice? but for this very reaſon it ought to ſeek the ſupport, and ſupplies and favour of God: leaſt being deſtitute of all help and redreſs, it lye ſtill in its infirmity expoſd to its enemies. Is it becauſe there are more incentives to ſin. It is much miſtaken, there are both farr more and more forcible ones to juſtice, and to make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin. If the world exhort us, God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us: if nature incline us, grace refrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes us; if the diveltempt us, the Angels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire us. Or is it becauſe the wicked flouriſh in a proſperous condition? O pure madnes! to love a momentary proſperity, and not feare an eternal calamity! Or becauſe thou hopeſt to have time in thy old age to reform thy ſelf; for God hath patiently expected many. O ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeles! life is not promiſd thee, but pardon is proferd thee: o ungratefull thou abuſeſt the grace and patience of God: look what thou doſt; God will not be taxd of injuſtice, if he grant thee not pardon when and how thou wilt, ſince thou wilt not accept it when he makes a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:39021:24"/> profer. Or is it laſtly becauſe the way of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and a ſpiritual life is thorny and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome? but will that of hell or the flames of Purgatory, troweſt thou, be any whit more eaſe full and pleaſant?</p>

                  <p>O You Cherubins and Seraphins who veyle your face and feet, becauſe you are aſhamd that ye love not my good God ſufficiently; lend me your tongues, lend me the voyce of an Archangel and the trumpet of God, that I may allarme the whole world, and ſound a ſummons to all mortals: ariſe ye dead even while ye live and come to judgment: come that ye may give your verdict upon a ſtrange and ſtupendious fact which happend but very lately. Come that ye may be moved to indignation, come that ye may be moved to laughter; or rather come that ye may be moved to teares. Ile tell you a lamentable ſtory which I know to be certainly true, and you ſhall judge whether it be not ſuch. Certain robbers dragd a woman tyed neck and heeles through foul and ſtenchy places and would needs caſt her into a glowing furnace too too dreadful for its raging flames- As they were going they met a king, one that for power and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:39021:24"/> other princely qualities was matchles; nay he was in all points ſo accompliſhd, that nature ſeemd to have beſtowd all her perfections upon him. He was more valiant then Samſon, more wiſe and wealthy then Salomon, more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and bountiful then David. He taking compaſſion upon this poor woman, to reſcue her out of their bands (for he was all alone) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to death; and having received many wounds, and loſt much blood; he put the robbers to flight: and to cleanſe her who was all covered over with filth, there being no fair water at hand, he made her a bath of his own blood: he took her for his ſpouſe though ſhe were a Black a more and very deformed, he crownd her queen, he built her a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent pallace, he adornd it moſt artificially, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graving every where his own images, which were to be ſo many memorials of him and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives of love to her: he allotted her a family, and gave her a fair retinue of ſervants: and which is more he doated ſo upon her, that he himſelf would become her ſervant even in mean offices: his ſole joy was to be alwayes in her company or thinking upon her; deſiring no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recompenſe of ſo much kindnes but a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal affection: laſtly he made her heir of his kingdome, promiſing that this ſhould be the leaſt expreſſion of his bounty, if ſhe would onely prove kind and loyal. Nevertheles as if ſo many benefits had tended onely to procure treachery and hatred contemning her ſpouſe and king, ſhe ſollicited his very ſlaves and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:39021:25"/> grooms of his ſtable to acts of adultery: yet they more loyal to their king did partly fly, and partly were murderd out of meer paſſion; for they choſe rather to periſh then be eye witneſſes of ſuch diſloyalty to their king and his ſpouſe. In a word every one reſented with deteſtation the queens unworthines; nor did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he for all that deſiſt to compel them, proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting her ſelf to all. Neyther did ſhe here put a period to her wickednes: but ſeeing him ſtil kind towards her, ſhe hatchd a piece of unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld treachery; ſhe betrayd him into the hands of his enemies whom he hated even to death; this wicked woman made him their ſlave and compelled him to ſerve his deadlyeſt foes; who blind-folded him, and made him their laughing ſtock: and which was the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of all being altogether inſenſible of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny guifts and curteſies, ſhe raignd moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently in all ſecurity and jollity, as if ſhe had done a piece of remarkable ſervice. Now judge, o ye men, now give your verdict; tel me if there be any one among you who wil not be repleniſhd with indignation againſt this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and wil not ſay; the Lord liveth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the woman that did this is a child of death. But the ſtory is not yet at an end: hitherto I have ſhewd her wickednes, now I muſt ſhew her folly. For while ſhe thus hated and ſcornd her faire ſpouſe and king ſhe never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs kiſſd the pictures of him which ſtood engraven here and there in his pallace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verened them exceedingly for their beauty,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:39021:25"/> which not withſtanding in compariſon of the king himſelf were ugly: nor did they intirely reſemble all his features, but one his eyes only, another his hands, a third his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: and they being both together, if he deſird to imbrace her ſhe turnd her back diſdaignfully, and loathing his perſon ſought after his image. Iudge now o mortals: The Lord liveth, becauſe the woman that doth this is a child of laughter.</p>
                  <p>O I wiſh I could intrap thee in the ſnare of Nathan and make thee relent with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of David! Thou o my ſoul art this woman. This ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael. I have annoynted thee, o man, king over all the creatures of the world: I have created all things for thy uſe; I have deliverd thee out of the hands of Saul and robbers, to wit, Lucifer and the divels; out of the filth in which thou didſt wallow, out of the flames of hel to which thou wert ſentencd; I cleanſed thee with my own blood, I gave thee the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly manſion-houſe of thy Lord and God and all the delights of heaven together with it; I appointed thee the houſe of this world as a kingly pallace and all creatures to be thy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants: and if theſe benefits of thy creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, redemption, and glorification be but ſlender ones. I will heap far greater upon thee: for which of all theſe doſt thou perſecute and contemne me? do my kindneſses ſeem crimes to thee? thou art angry at me and puniſhes me as men do malefactours who are chaſtizd with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:39021:26"/> the inſtruments by which they offended: thou abuſeſt my very guifts, condemning me in them, as if I became criminal by my wel doing. Which of my favours deſerves theſe thy injuries? tel me and I will amend it; ile be thy revenger upon my ſelf, becauſe I deſird nothing more then thy good wil, nor do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, nor ſhall I. To make thee love me Iam ready to deſtroy the world, if it were injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to thee that I made it. If I were faulty in dying for thee, Ile dye again to make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and come to an attonement. If it were a crime that I prepard my glory and heaven for thee; upon condition thou wouldſt pardon me, I would relinquiſh it once again and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate my ſelf, depriving my ſelf of my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and glory. Why doſt thou think thoſe things, which if they were done betwixt man and man would be accounted vertues worthy of praiſe, being now done to thee by God, to be crimes deſerving nothing lesthen diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and death? But if thou eſteem thoſe things as benefits, which I have heapd upon thee with all the extent of my omnipotency and purchaſe of my ſufferings, why doſt thou ſeek to affront me ſtil more and more. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance my offence was in this that my bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits were ſo many and great, (for in each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular I can acknowledg no fault) and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wilt puniſh me with the greatnes and multitude of contempts and ſtrive to out number my kindneſſes by thy affronts: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thou alone haſt pickt up the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:39021:26"/> debaucheryes of the lewdeſt woemen againſt me thy lover to caſt them into my diſh. Thou didſt take complacence in the impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Putiphars wife, and thou itching to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe the ſame againſt me, coveteſt to play the harlot with the ſervants which I aſſigned thee, to witt, creatures: and thou compelſt them to this; nor wilt thou learn by their loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty who run from thee like Ioſeph, and ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſs away preſently or periſh: they all are ful of a deep reſentment and repleniſhd with ſorrow for the throwes and pangs of thoſe that being violated by thee, are ready to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, it being much againſt their will that thou ſinneſt with them, or art enamoured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to the prejudice of thy ſpouſe and their Lord and Soveraign. But thou heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iniquity upon iniquity ſlanderſt them for giving thee the ſlip, and complainſt of them for running away. This is the common complaint of mortals, that their Gods are mortal, that creatures are fading and periſhable. Thou criminateſt them for being the occaſion of thy adultery; when they as innocent, faithfull to their God and thy wel wiſhers, fly from thee that thou mayſt not commit it by loving them with an inordinate affection. But thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieſt, ſaying if I were wealthy, if I had riches, if I enjoyd this or that commodity, I would ſerve God peaceably nor deſire more: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have loſt all, and the goods of this would fly me, I can not but doe thus: want compels me to ſin, poverty puts me upon
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:39021:27"/> unlawful deſires to the great prejudice of my own ſpirit. Leave of complaining, ceaſe to blame them, and rather give eare to creatures, who teach thee thy duty better then Ioſeph. Behold ſay they, our Lord forgetful of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gives thee all; neither is there any thing which he hath not ſubiected to thy power, to doe with it what thou wilt, this onely exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, not to love us; how canſt thou be ſo il-naturd, as to offend thy God? how can we admit of this thy love which thy Creatour hath reſervd to himſelf? He hath given us to thee that thou mightſt give thy ſelf to him: we ſerve thee that thou mayſt ſerve him: learn of us to ſerve him to death, and play not the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer. We are deſtroyd that thou mayſt ſubſiſt; for we have neither ſcandalizd thee, nor given thee il example: we covet not to be loved by thee, but rather wiſh thee to give him the beſt thing thou haſt, to wit, thy love. Love him and praiſe him as we doe. Learn zeale of us, for to the end thou mayſt do ſo we willingly ſuffer our ſelves to be deſtroyed: Learn to dye that the glory of God may live, for to the end thou mayſt live we dye. Learn humility of us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for being thy ſiſters equal in noblenes of parentage, yea elder by birth, we diſdain not to ſerve thee even in abject things that thou mayſt reign with thy ſpouſe and love him. That thou mayſt live eternally with him we are turnd into filth and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption nor do we detrect any the meaneſt offices for thy ſake with manifeſt hazard of our deſtru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:39021:27"/> only we cannot brook that on the altar of God, that is thy hart, idols of us ſhould be placed through a diſorderly affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, thou thinking oftner upon us then him, and ſacrificing to us not beaſts but thy own ſoul. Fy fy, be aſhamd to make a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial ſoul the victime of a piece of earthly met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or vain honour, or momentary pleaſure, &amp; in it divine grace, &amp; by that eternal glory.</p>
                  <p>Thou tookſt content moreover, o ſoul, in the treachery of Dalila, and forthwith attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptedſt to practiſe the like upon me thy God and thy lover. Thou betraydſt me into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity like Samſon to my greateſt enemies, and madeſt me a ſlave to the Philiſtians of thy ſins: for thou madeſt me ſerve thee in them, thou madeſt me toile in thy iniquities, neither have I any other foe ſo hateful to me as ſin: thou nevertheles art the occaſion, that I who make the ſun to riſe, and ſend ſhowers at due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, watering the fruits of the earth, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the apples on the trees, furniſhing the paſtures with graſs for the cattles ſuſtenance, thou I ſay art the occaſion that I ſerve thy gluttonous appetite, and in the mines which I engenderd in the bowels of the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a drudge to thy avarice.

But what if they ſhould not onely deſert him but his ſtatue alſo, and do their obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to the print of his foot, and that in no better element then clay, fruſtrating all his expectation, and ſleighting his majeſty. Thou doſt this, o my ſoul, while thou loveſt and adoreſt the mangled and miſhapd goodnes of creatures which is but a trace or imperfect print of the divine, contemning that origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal goodnes ſo majeſtique ſo compleat ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>autiful.

Set a real and painted diſh of meat before one that is hungry, will he covet to feed on the painted? and why then deſireſt thou ſhadowes &amp; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and ſeeks not after a real good? Man is more abſurd then a dog who if he light on a piece of bread he takes it, and leaves it not to bite at a ſhadow: but thou leaving God; embraceſt his ſhadow. Why deſireſt thou a part rather then the whole? if one that is thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſee two pitchers, the one whole, the other broken, wil he leave the whole one and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with the eare of the broken, or ſome other fragment to take up water to quench his thirſt? creatures are onely partial images of the divine goodnes, whoſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are divided among created natures; why wilt thou chooſe a part rather then the whole, and a part of that whol, which availes not but in the whole, neither do creatures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſingly a part nor all together but only in God: broken pitchers nor any fragment of

                  <p>Learn the true uſe of creatures they are not to work upon the will, but to help the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Thou, forgetting God, amuzes and buſies thy will, but does not ſatiate it; and becauſe it is not ſatiated, thou mayſt eaſily know thou art deluded. Albeit thou love all the goods of this world, yea and enjoy them all, yet ſtil thy deſire will be as empty and hungry as ever. Painted bread doth not fil one, but is onely a figure of that which fils; ſo created goods do not ſatiate the appetite but are reſemblances of that which ſatiates, to wit God. All the goods of this world ſtand proportiond to our will as a painted fire to a cold hand; one may take it and apply it, but ſhal find neither warmth nor refreſhment.

                  <p>Thou croſſes and thwarts the deſignes of God, adoring that very thing for him, by which he forewarnd thee, that thou ſhouldſt adore nothing but him. Go too, croſs thy own deſire, curbing whatſoever it covets by interpoſal of the divine goodnes, that in the deſire of things thy appetite may ayme at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God. Is any thing preſented as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful? oppoſe God forthwith as a ſtrong ſhield, and ſay, how wil this be in my ſpouſe. I will not buſy my ſelf about this crum of handſomnes, about this mote of ſweetnes, but wil drink larged raughts of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in God, and glut my ſelf with his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reliſhes: I wil no longer feed with Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus upon crums. If a ſlubberd buſines can delight thee, will not much more a fair coppy? Bulls are diverted and amuzd by caſting a cloak or ſome other thing before them on which without hurt to the man they ſpend their fury: and doe thou object God to thy roaming deſires, that ſpending themſelves fruitfully on him they may be diverted from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:39021:30"/> created things. By this meanes, o effeminate ſpirit, thou ſhalt both wholſomely and in its own kind defeat the poiſon of thy own appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite effecting that the very affection to things which induceth an oblivion of God, become to thee a memorial of divine love and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of charity. The deſire wherewith the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man thirſts after a piece of mony wil be more hightend, if an offer be made of a piece of gold; becauſe the value of ſilver is not only equalizd but outſtript in gold: ſo muſt thou object God to thy itching deſire of riches and pleaſures, the value of them all being containd in him with a vaſt exceſs. Hence thou ſhalt experience incredible fruit. God ſhal inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly be propoſd to thee as preſent, and thy love towards him ſhal be ſo improved, that thou mayſt traffique among the neceſſary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of wordly employments without any great prejudice; til thy-ſpirit being more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>find and robuſtious, thou beeſt admitted to the ſtrayter embracements of thy ſpouſe, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures now not diſquieting thee but becoming ſo noyſome, that this very viſible heaven, wil be loathſome to thy eyes in compariſon of my God and my IESVS. He that ſees the ſun is blind to the ſtars, and creatures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard with their Creatour are unſightly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury. Stars becauſe they borrow their light from the ſun are as it were nothing in his preſence, they being inviſible: ſo all things that are, becauſe they take from thee, o God the lover of men their eſſence and beeing,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:39021:31"/> as it were nothing before thee, before thy ſupereſſential eſſence and goodnes.</p>
                  <p>But there is yet another important commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity redounding to him that loaths creatures. Doſt thou hear of any one that loves or deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res them? blush and lament that one ſo leag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with thee in nature ſhould be ſo forgetful of God: and ſtir, up thy ſelf, and labour to repaire this common diſgrace by loving thy Creatour for both. Deem thy ſelf guilty of all the affection which the world beſtowes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on periſhable things, and make ſatisfaction by loving eternal. Account thy ſelf a debter for all the inclinations by which things are carried to their center, nor prolong the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rearing thy mind and love more impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly towards heaven then a ſtone is carried downwards from heaven. All created things ſeeking by an in bred propenſion to partake of happines, ſhew that they love a trace of the divine goodnes: be thou confounded and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that thou loveſt not more eagarly true goodnes and happines it ſelf, ſince grace is prevalent above nature. O what a thing muſt that needs be, whoſe ſhadow creatures love with ſo much vehemency, to which the total love of all things lives and breaths! do thou endeavour to collect in thy ſelf all the diſperſd inclinations, all the errours of deſires, that thou mayſt haſten towards God and make amends for the forgetfulnes of man.</p>

                  <head>The VIII. Chapter. <hi>The affections of a true Penitent.</hi>

                  <p>TRansfer transfer my ſins from me, o moſt loving father, who art in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for ſo I am confident to cal thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> animated therto by the conſent and doctrine of thy beſt beloved Son IESVS, ſo to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh thee from that father in hel to which I adopted my ſelf by my ſins, chuſing by them to become a child of the divel and ſuch I was for a long time. I lay open my horrid and numberles crimes before thee, which if it were in my power, I would conceale from thee, and waſh them away with my harts blood, that thy ſacred countenance might not be defild with ſuch a ſpectacle. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the blood neither of al men nor beaſts can cancel ſo much as one of them, therfore I ſhew them to thee that with one drop of the blood of thy beloved Son IESVS thou mayſt quite obliterate and deface them. I ſhew to thee what I have committed againſt thee; for my malice doth not leſſen thy goodnes. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all my malignity and innumerable miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours, thou, o father, remaines ſtill good. If then I, who am evil, nay ſtark nought, am repleniſhd with horrour at the ſight of my offences, how much more wilt thou who art good, yea goodnes it ſelf, how wilt thou be able to endure ſuch monſters &amp; not forthwith
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:39021:32"/> aboliſh and deſtroy them. Thou being ſo good doſt more deteſt ſin then I that am ſo bad either now hate it, or ever heretofore loved it. I tried to waſh them away with a flood of teares, but no ſoap will take out theſe ſtaines beſides the blood of thy beloved IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS. I am in the hel of my own wickednes, and demand not a drop of water as that rich glutton did of Father Abraham, but I that am rich and moſt wealthy in all iniquity beg a drop of Chriſts blood of the father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. My intent is not to defraud thy juſtice by this my petition, but only not to offend thy goodnes; I do more earneſtly beg that thou wilt waſh of the ſtaine then remit the paine.</p>
                  <p>O heavenly father I do equally and with the ſame armes embrace and welcome thy ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice upon me as I do thy mercy towards me: I do not ſo much beg a forgoeing of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, as pardon of my faultines. I wiſh moſt earneſtly and from the bottome of my hart, that I could collect the deſires of all creatures into one, and could make them all beg with joint conſent that thy juſtice would take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon my delinquency. I would willin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly undergoe all the paints of hell inflicted both on men and divels, neither ſhould they appale me, upon condition that thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance might not terrify me. Sin is a more hideous evil then they; yea beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon; becauſe my ſin alone is evil, they are good, becauſe thou inflicts them. Yea
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:39021:32"/> and if they were all heapt upon me, they would not render me more evil, my malice being mixt and attemperd with their good; neither ſhould I be compounded meerly and purely of malice but ſhould have ſome ingredient of good from thee, derived to me from thy ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
                  <p>But, o father of mercy, I am afraid leaſt while I ſeek to deteſt ſin humbly, I ſin a new arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly. I could wiſh I went to hel if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, by doing ſo, to obtain thy grace. But how dare I, that am nothing but an extract of ſin, wiſh that, which thy greateſt Saints and choiſeſt favorits have made their ſuit and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble petition. How dare I wiſh onely a hel, who alone am the ſinner of ſinners. What place ſhall I pretend to there? Shall it be in the very center of it at the feet of Lucifer? If ſome one of thy friends had an ambition to be there how dare I pretend it? that place was deſird by ſome of thy Saints and proved to them a ladder to heaven. Thy ſervant B. Vri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gman of the Order of S. Dominick, when he could find no fit place for himſelf but in the bottome of hel under Lucifer, was invited by a voice from heaven to mount up thither to a moſt ſublime throne, the hart of God the father: and how then dare I covet that place? what then? will there remain ſome other place for me below all who am a ſinner above all? Shal it be at the feet of ludas? but this is already taken up by thy ſervant, Saint Francis Borgia, who not withſtanding quitted
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:39021:33"/> it, when he reflected that ſometime it had bin the ſeat of my Lord and maſter the humble IESVS. What place then remaines for me? Shal it be at the feet of him who gave IESVS the buffet on the face I having given him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more ſuch injurious blowes? or at the feet of Caiphas, being I daily condemn Chriſt and his doctrine: or at the gate of hel that all who enter there may tread upon me? or ſhal I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the precipice of Anti-chriſt into that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal pit, that I may ſuffer under his feet? o moſt bountiful ſoveraign, worſe then the worſt of all ſinners am I, there is no place for me in hel who am unworthy of al place. I hold my ſelf not worthy even of the fellowſhip of divels; in ſo much that according to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert a viler and more penal hel ought to be prepard for me: I am the diſgrace of nature the ſcum and refuſe of mankind! If thou, o father, wert capable of ſhame, thou wouldſt be aſhamd of nothing ſave only preſerving me in the world, ſuch a horrid and abominable mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſter as my ſins have made me.</p>
                  <p>Nay I am a diſcredit even to the divels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and they might deſervedly diſcard me from their infernal community. Am I not worſe then the divels? It is clear I am in my nature, and I do not deny it in my behaviour and carriage; yea I ſee many things in my ſelf which force me to grant it. For they were damned for one ſin and that of thought only, whereas mine are infinite and moſt enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and of fact alſo. What difference then
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:39021:33"/> or exceſs is there betwixt my malice and theirs? as much as there is betwixt a ſingle unity, and a number that's numberles: But though we alter theſe conditions, yet ſtil I muſt acknowledge my malice greater then theirs, although they had bin damnd for innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable offences and I but for one. For they did not ſin againſt a God, who for their ſakes became an Angel, neither had they ſuch a ful proof of his goodnes: they did not ſin againſt a God, who for them vouchſafd to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyd: they did not ſin againſt a God, who made himſelf the food of their ſoules: they did not ſin againſt a God, who left them ſuch a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime Prieſthood: they did not ſin againſt a God, who by his example gave them the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments of a good life, and did undergo the inceſſant labours of 33. yeares in inculcating them. But I have ſinn'd (and why doſt thou not, o my ſoul, diſſolve into teares at the very thought of it) againſt a God, who ſo often hath bin ſo immenſely good on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, who dy'd for me, who wept for me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſs with loud out-cryes, and not a joint of his body but bewaild each of my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, in the garden with teares of blood. I am more unworthy then Lucifer, more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy then the divels, more vnworthy then Iudas, who had not as yet ſeen Chriſt dying for him, more vnworthy then Anti-chriſt, who will not ſo often as I, experience the great mercy of God: deſervedly therfore may they diſdain my company; neither is hel
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:39021:34"/> worthy of me, nor would it willingly receive my ſinfulnes.</p>
                  <p>Tis more then this hel that I deſerve; I have merited to be caſt out of all nature, leaſt I diſhonour it, who have diſgraced its graceful glory. I have murderd as much as lay in me, its parent; I have taken the crown of creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res from of his head: I have diſhonourd each creature by contemning their Creatour: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ought to be the but and object of all their hatred, and they all rejoyce at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Perchance I ſhould beg this, if it were poſſible that I who am the reproach of nature, the diſpite of grace, the moth of the divine wil, could not have had a being; Notwithſtanding becauſe I deſerve to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, what place ſhal I find fit for it?</p>
                  <p>Thou o infinite power, o incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wiſdome, o immenſe juſtice, thou canſt tel what to doe with me. In the meane time till a place be found and prepard, Ile expect not beneath Satan, nor at the feet of Iudas, nor wil I before hand take Anti-chriſts place, of all which as yet I acknowledg my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy; but I wil place my ſelf at the feet of the Son of God, and his B. Mother, ſtanding &amp; weeping at the foot of the croſs of my IESVS; for they are better ſtored with patience, and wil tolerate me, whom neither the divel, nor Iudas, nor the rout of the damned, would be able to endure. Pardon me I beſeech thee, if I intrench upon the patience of thy Son and his Virgin Mother. Let me lie at the feet of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:39021:34"/> IESVS and Mary; they know long agoe how to tread underfoot venimous creatures. I am that poyſonous and ſauage Chimera, that four-formd deformity, that manifold mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter having the eyes of a baſilisk, the head of an aſp the clawes of a lion, and the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenes of a dragon. But, o father of mercy, becauſe my IESVS cannot as now walk upon me a baſilisk and aſpe, nor trample down this lion and dragon (for my ſins keep his feet faſt bound to the croſs) therfore let the heel, of the moſt B. Virgin Mary my Mother, in the interim bruize this malice of mine, let her cruſh the head of this ſerpent, by her mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful interceſſion. I am cauſe of her ſorrow, &amp; guilty of her teares; ſhe may juſtly complain of me and take revenge upon me. The feet of the pureſt IESVS are welinurd both to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate and take away the monſters of our ſins. I ſeek not them amidſt banquets and delights as did the Magdalen, but among nailes and ſorrowes; and becauſe I cannot water them with my teares, I covet to be waſhd with their blood. I wil not intangle thoſe feet which I behold, with my locks, leaſt my Lord be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fly from the horrour and naſtines of my ſins: I behold them fetterd with ſharp irons, and that was my doing. But if it were a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teful piece of ſervice, which Magdalen did to theſe feet, the torment alſo which was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſiond by my ſins could not be ungrateful. I, o Lord, faſtned them, my malice was more prevalent towards this, then the goodnes of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:39021:35"/> all other creatures. The Angels grieve and ſtand amazed; creatures tremble and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; all law diſavowes it, all right cryes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; my ſins alone exacted the death of thy onely begotten Son and compaſd it.

Behold me here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I was the chiefe Crucifyer, the prime executioner. I furniſhd his hands putting a hammer in his right and a naile in his left: I firſt of all others gave that hand the dint which tranſpiered thoſe tender feet. O how much more heynous was my offence then theirs, who executed only Pilates ſentence and the will of the Iewes! They being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded crucified, him whom they held no more then a man and a malefactour, and one ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurd in his whole countenance, by that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous nights work. I have again, as much as in me lay, crucified him being now glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who for me was heretofore crucified. Which of the Iewes beholding Chriſt as Saint Stephen beheld him, at the right hand of God, durſt cry out aloud crucify him? but I have bin ſo impudently bold as not only to ſay it, but even more then do it. I clear and quit the executioners of Chriſt: they will be confounded in the latter day beholding him glorious whom they treated ſo ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: I ſeeing him that was crucified for my ſake glorious, am not confounded but have

                  <p>O Father as often as I call this to mind, conſidering thy infinite mercy, by which thou didſt patiently ſuſtain my ſo great in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, I cannot but wiſh thy exemplary ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice upon me; I cannot detrect the paines of hell as due to my iniquity, ſuppoſing the paine were voyd of guilt. Shal divine love be les forcible then humane, or charity more feeble then concupiſcence, the love of thee, then the love of me? If my ſelf love could make me contemne God, why cannot the love of God make me throughly diſpiſe my ſelf, and debaſe my ſelf even to hel? Again, again I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracingly kiſs thy juſtice: puniſh and revenge upon me thy affronts and juſt indignation; for I who prophaned and violated all thy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, ſeeking to deſtroy them by ſin as much as I could, do now wiſh ſuch a penance and remiſſion, as would make a ful reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all, and leave them in their integrity.

                  <p>IT is not meet that thou, o faintharted ſpirit, have but a faint deſire of that which is the chiefeſt good. Grace and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are ſiſters, and they have the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour &amp; parent God. If thou learnſt not of thy IESVS how to frame thy deſires, who deſird ſo earneſtly to ſuffer for thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that thou mayſt be aſhamd not to deſire moſt ardently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with him: learn at leaſt of natural things how thou art to covet heavenly. Nature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no good to any creature, unles a ſtrong appetite therof did go before and if there be not ſuch a precedent appetency ariſing from grace, thou ſhalt never be guifted with any ſignal vertue. Natural things ayme at more then they can attaine to: fire when it mounts upward covets nothing more then to reach its element, and yet it never can reach its home: but yet that exceſs of deſire was requiſite, to carry it to a higher region. A ſtone when it fals, covets to deſcend even to the hart or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the earth, and yet it remaines on the ſurface or ſuperficies. What a vehement affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is inbred to beaſts towards their of ſpring? A cow in the abſence of her calf bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes without end, and haſtens thither as faſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:39021:37"/> as ſhe can where ſhe thinks to find it. The ſame innate love, armes other creatures which are of a more fearful and ſoft diſpoſition, and exaſperates and renders them fierce and hardy: and this ſtrong deſire, was neceſſary to make them break through all difficulties in rearing their young ones. Perfect vertue and union with God is a buſines ful of oppoſition; and how canſt thou overcome this unles thou ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly and earneſtly intend it. A natural appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is a diſpoſition to natural perfection; and a great and ſupernatural appetite diſpoſeth a ſoul to ſupernatural perfection, and to receive the graces and guifts of God in greater plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Chriſt compard thoſe that traffique for the kingdome of heaven to marchants &amp; ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; and ſtiled them happy that hunger and thirſt after juſtice; combining in the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame thing two moſt vehement appetites. There is no ſtint in deſiring to pleaſe God: there is no other meane nor ſtint, but that one alwayes without all meane and interruption, wiſh and imbrace indefatigably the croſs, &amp; never be ſatiated with ſuffering. So ought thou to ſerve God with the whole extent and intenſenes of thy mind; and all this is very requiſite, that thou faint not under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of difficulties; neither is any ſtrength imaginable equivalent to the leaſt particle of the divine infinitude.</p>
                  <p>God is infinite; and how then dareſt thou, o ſtrait-harted creature, limit and bound thy deſires? The fading goods of this world are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:39021:37"/> deſird a hundred, yea a thouſand times more then they covet or deſerve to be, and are not for all that obtained. God is immenſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and ought to be deſird more then infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely; and why breathſt thou after him ſo faintly and rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A moſt intenſe deſire is a golden key that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks the gates of heaven, and opens the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to all our ſpiritual progreſs: for as no meane thing is compaſsd without ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent deſire of it, ſo the moſt difficult and pretious of all others cannot be attained but with a moſt ardent one. To obtaine terrene joyes, it is requiſite that our deſire far exceed their worth and value, that ſo it may make us maſter all rubs that occur in their purchaſe; and is it not an arrand ſhame, that our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the eternal joyes of Gods infinity, ſhould be ſo pitty fully remiſs, and rate them ſo much below their worth, below what they exact and we may afford?</p>
                  <p>Grant me grace, o Lord, thou who out of thy exceſſive deſire of ſuffering for me, wert ſtraitned ſo far, as to be baptizd in thy own blood, that I may be carried with a moſt intenſe deſire towards thee. What ought to be dear to me either in heaven or earth beſides thee, my God and the lover of me; and next
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:39021:38"/> to thee, what but to ſuffer for and with thee? It is a profound act of contrition, and a love due to the divine goodnes, to be willing to ſuffer for the leaſt vemal ſin, yea to impede the leaſt in any body elſe, as much as in me lyes, the paines of hel through all eternity: and how much, o Lord, ſhould I covet to ſuffer for my ſpiritual advancement and rather then I my ſelf commit that? And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding how little am I ſollicitous for thy glory? my whole employment ought to tend to the compaſſing of this by deſire, prayer, ſighs, and teares; and ſince all I can do, is litle or nothing in compariſon of thy greatnes, my good wil muſt make amends for my inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſupply for my defectuouſnes.</p>

If a little leven mar the whole batch, how can he be untainted and unlevened, who is ſo incorporated with the world, whoſe whole lump is ſtark naught, where the bad a lone are accounted good, and they ſo numerous. He that is once dead to the world, let him beware he revive not to it again by dying to God, or coveting worldly things, although he neither poſſeſs nor enjoy them. The love of temporalities is wont to harme us more then the uſe and poſſeſſion of them: its not the thing but the affection to the thing which hurts us, which affection is more reſtleſly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in its abſence. Be not according to Saint Iude a tree twice dead and unfruitful. He dies to the world who relinquiſheth the world; he is defunct to God who returnes to it again. Such a one having loſt the fruit and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of a worldly life, looſeth alſo the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of a ſpiritual, and conſequently is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unprofitable and barren to himſelf.

Know that it is not changed ſince thou left it, nor grown better by length of time, nor that it affords any more ſecurity then it did, but is rather worſe every day then other. It decayes daily; it doats more and more by age: an errour gaines autority by being old; its wine, drinks with a ſtronger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of malice, for being long kept: vices the more inveterate they are get a more undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſcription, and new ones ariſe daily.

It is intollerable and perfidious even to thoſe who, did ſtick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and without breach of truſt to it, what will it then be to thee, who haſt revolted both from it and God, loyal to neither? wherfore the world wil chaſtize thee as a fugitive, and God will not defend thee, by reaſon of thy treachery. There are more urgent reaſons now of not returning to the world, then there were at firſt of leaving it, or at leaſt the ſame are now in force which forcd thee then to quit it. It is blind and a cheat, both to it ſelf and thee, of a baſe nature, and to be deſpiſd even although otherwiſe not deſpicable; becauſe it hinders great good and torments its lovers, be ſet on all ſides with the dangers, not only of temporal things, but which is more of eternal alſo: it is nothing elſe but falſhood and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:39021:39"/> for beſides that it is malicious and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated in cozening others, it is alſo cozend it ſelf, in ſo much that worldly men will decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve thee, even when they intend nothing leſs then deceits The very wiſdome of the world is pure folly: how then ſhal truth appeare in it? and when all the light it hath is darknes, how great darknes muſt that needs be? its whole train of attendance &amp; foundations, are inſtruments of blindnes and dim the eyes of our judgment, to wit pride gluttony, luſt, envy, ambition, anger, to which we may add treachery, in ſo much that Iudas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like even when it fawnes moſt upon them it betraies its darlings by that kiſs to perdition and the power of darknes.</p>
                  <p>The world is a cheat: it ſels its glory, which is nothing, at a high rate. And it were a ſmal matter if it were only nothing, and not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious alſo. Men glory in thoſe things of which they ought to be aſhamd: it lies againſt all experience in telling them that their riches wil be permanent, ſince they paſs through ſo many hands to come to them who now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them. It holds thoſe things forth for good, each one wherof is no leſs then a triple torment: the number of evils and vexations are in ſuch an exceſs, that it affords more then two real afflictions for one ſeeming happines. Ther's no one thing of all we poſſeſs, but rackd us with toile and ſollicitude how we might compaſs it; and having compaſd it, we are no les tormented with fear and iealouſy
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:39021:40"/> of it; and when it is loſt, with grief for its abſence and privation. O heavenly truth, what great God a mercy, if I do not covet this meer chaos of deceitfulnes and vexation? if I contemn for thy ſake a thing ſo contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, which were to be contemnd if not for it ſelf at leaſt for my ſelf? many heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers quitted the world for their own quiet, and why ſhal not a Chriſtian do it for his and thy glory? They left it becauſe deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable in it ſelf; and why ſhal not we do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art ineſtimable, and the glory which we hope for invaluable. Although the world were good, yet it were folly to prefer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, which containes all good.</p>

                  <p>THou canſt not live wel unles thou dye forthwith and overcome thy nature. Thou canſt not enjoy peace unles thou make war upon thy ſelf; this is the way to purchaſe true liberty. Be readier alwayes to comply with anothers will then thy own &amp; thou ſhalt not know what it is to be at jars: love rather to have little then much, and thou ſhalt have no occaſion of complaint: chuſe alwayes the meaneſt place, and to be every ones underling, and thou ſhalt ſcarſe ever be

If thou ought to accommodate thy ſelf rather to anothers wil then thy own, why not to the divine wil, and rejoyce that it is fulfilld by thee? keep theſe things in thy hart that thou mayſt enjoy an uninterrupted peace. True tranquillity of mind cannot be obtaind but by a contempt of the world and conqueſt over our ſelves. This may be done two manner of wayes; either by forcing thy ſelf, contrary to what ſeems good and delectable in the world and nature; or by knowing them to be nought, and weighing all things in the ballance of truth: this latter way is the ſweeter and more permanent, although it muſt alwayes be accompanyd with a fervor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contradiction of our appetite. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheles who in faith and ſpirit is convined of the verity and vanity that is in things, ſhal with much facility overcome himſelf and diſpiſe the world.</p>
                  <p>Nothing conduceth more to a happy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, then to frame an unbyazd judgment of things, and to reliſh them according to the doctrine of IESVS. What hearſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncd by that moſt holy mouth of truth it ſelf? bleſſed are the poor of ſpirit; bleſſed are they that mourn; bleſſed are they that ſuffer perſecution. Why wilt thou eſteem thoſe things harſh and burdenſome which the truth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:39021:41"/> of God held and deliverd for beatitudes? how canſt thou avoid being deceivd, if thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thoſe things evil, which faith teaches us to be good, and to render us happy? we believe the myſtery of the moſt B. Trinity becauſe Chriſt reveald it to us: the ſame IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS alſo reveald, that thoſe things which the world ſo much abhors, poverty, ſorrow, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, are not bad but good; neither is he to be ratherd is believd in this point, by him that knowes he taught ſo, then when be teacheth the unity and Trinity of almighty God. Let us then make a true eſtimate of truth, and frame our dictamens point blank oppoſite to worldly maxims. O eternal truth, grant me grace that according to thy doctrin I may judg all temporal things meer lyes, and thoſe far from containing great good, which bring ſo much hurt. Grant me that I may not live in an errour by prizing thoſe things highly which I ought to have in hatred. If it be a matter of faith that poverty, humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, affliction, are not only good but bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying; why do not I rather chuſe to have litle then much, to be diſpiſd then prayſd, to be afflicted then ſwim in delights?</p>
                  <p>He that walks in faith and truth, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things truly good which CHRIST judgeth ſuch, ought to be ſo far from being contriſtated for any want or vexation, that he ſhould covet them with his utmoſt deſires, and rejoyce in them, and abhor wholy and not in part only, all things which the world
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:39021:41"/> loveth and embraceth, and admit and deſire with his whole hart, with his whole ſoul, with all his ſtrength, with all his mind, what ſoever IESVS loved and embracd. Like as worldlings who follow love and ſeek with great earneſtnes thoſe things which belong to the world, to wit honours, fame, and the opinion of a great name upon earth, as the world teacheth and deceives them: ſo thoſe that make a progreſs in ſpirit and truth, doe ſeriouſly follow, love, and ardently deſire whatſoever is altogether oppoſite to theſe, that is, to be clad with the ſame livery and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of contempt which the Lord of glory wore. Inſomuch that if it could be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any offence of the divine Majeſty and ſin of their neighbour, they would ſuffer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies, falſe witnes, affronts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be thought and accounted fooles (they giving neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les no occaſion of it) becauſe they deſire to reſemble and imitate in ſome manner the Son of God.

Why wilt thou live in guile and deceit, making no reckning of thoſe things which God prizd and honored ſo highly, that he thought them worthy of his beſt beloved and only begotten Son.</p>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:39021:42"/> with the whole extent of our hart: and for this ſole cauſe that he diſpiſd all worldly goods, though men have them in ſo great eſteem, they are to be held baſe and infamous, and deſervedly to be abhord more then death it ſelf. IESVS overcome with love of us, made choice of theſe things the world hateth, and why ſhal not we for his ſake at leaſt accept them. What do I ſay for love of IESVS? we ought to do it for love of our ſelves. He that loves his ſoul and his life, let him love to dye even while he yet liveth. If thou loveſt life, why wilt thou not rather love an eternal and happy one then this wretched and momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? whoſoever loves any thing as good to himſelf, aymes alwayes at that which is more perfect: and by good conſequence, he that loves life, muſt not love a temporal but eternal life; who loves good things, muſt not love earthly but heavenly goods: wherfore our very affection to things compels us to diſaffect all worldly things. Ther's no body that loves any good thing but he wiſheth it perpetual: though the contrary be abſurd, yet we alwaies do it; for through our love to life and goods, we ſuffer great detriment both of life and goods. Tel me, o thou wretched of the world, who art ſo forgetful of eternal life, whether doſt thou deſpiſe theſe tranſitory things or love them? If thou diſpiſeſt them, it muſt be for this reaſon becauſe thou ſeekſt after bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if thou loveſt them, how much are greater things more worthy of love. How ever the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:39021:42"/> caſe ſtands, it is convinced that we ought to love eternal things, which will accrue to us ſo much more copiouſly, by how much the more we are impoveriſhd diſeſteemd, &amp; afflicted for God. Notwithſtanding all this, the ſufferings of this life are in no degree pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the future glory; for what is here but light and momentary, works in us an eternal poize of the ſame. Our proviſion for eternity may be prepard with much facility, and ought to be kept with all carefulnes. Each one furniſheth moſt plentifully the place he intends for his longeſt abode: and where his reſidence is to be but for a ſhort time, that he regards but ſleightly and provides it but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially. An eternity expects us in the other life, we muſt lay up ſtore of merits for it, leaſt we make our proviſions prepoſterouſly, beſtowing great care on a ſhort abode, and little on a long.</p>
                  <p>But we ought to have tranſitory things in hatred not only in regard of the eternal life, but even in reſpect of this temporal, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and vex us with a thouſand cares while we are procuring them, and with a thouſand feares and frights leaſt we fal ſhort of them: we brook any loſs but impatiently which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening ſo frequently as they do, we are toſſd in a continual ſea of griefe, anger, and endles vexations. He alone who goes contrary to the world lives without contrariety and in a holy repoſe. How then do theſe things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the name of goods which are ſo noyſome
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:39021:43"/> and tormenting to us? rather the quite op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ate to be ſtiled ſuch, which far ſooner render us ſuch, by putting us in mind of our preſent condition, by making us think upon God and have recourſe to him, by occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our greater merit, and aſſimilating us to the only begotten Son of God. The lover of men IESVS did moſt truly tearm thoſe not only good but alſo beatifying Yea the choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of the heathen Philoſophers, held not thoſe things, which the world ſo much ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, good, but their contrary. Some of them hated and rejected temporal riches, that at leaſt in this life, void of care and fear and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity of mind, they might enjoy a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral felicity. It redounds to our great ſhame that heathens ſhould do ſo, who wanted the example of the Son of God, who were out of hopes of other goods, and this when the world was in its youth and verdure, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded more with ſuch allurements though falſe and counterfeyt. But we have the glory of imitating IESVS, and the incentive of a heavenly reward: the world moreover is now grown worſe and more deformed, and wants not only ſolid goods but alſo fading. Now it ſcarſe hath where with all to bait a deceitful book; its falſe varniſh is waſhd of, in ſo much that it cannot deceive us, unles we deceive our ſelves.</p>

                  <p>VVHy ſeekſt thou any thing of the world, if thou be above the world? why loveſt thou any earthly thing ſince thou art beloved of God? How can he ſtick in the mud of nature who is elevated to the ſtate of grace? O good as little underſtood as much neglected! God hath beſtowd large and pretious promiſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to make us ſharers of his divine nature. Why ſeeks he any thing beſides God who hath found the grace of God, which raiſeth him above all nature, yea even that of the higheſt Thrones, Cherubins, and Seraphins, if therrs be conſiderd in it ſelf, though ſo far ſurpaſſing all other created ſubſtance; by which we have God for our Father, for our friend, and unſeparable Achates. It's account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a matter of high concernment among men to have precedency of place or dignity before others; and what wil it then be to have a pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence above all the degrees of nature? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the world were never ſo eſtimable, &amp; the things in it beyond our valuation, yet they ought to be contemnd by one in the ſtate of grace. The divel is intolerably proud; yet
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:39021:44"/> he regards not the opinions of men concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, nor deems himſelf one iot the worſe for being revild by them he ſeeks not popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar applauſe, he ſleights material things, he loaths what we reliſh ſo ſavourly, he ſcofs at our affaires, and all this for no other reaſon but becauſe he is of a more ſublime nature; why then is man who is raiſd to a participation of Gods nature, who is rankd in the higheſt claſs of creatures, ſo ſollicitous about theſe baſe trifles? certainly if he underſtood throughly the dignity that is conferd upon him by being rightly confeſſd and put in the ſtate of grace nothing elſe would be requiſite to make him contemne and deride theſe fopperies of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; nor were any great ſtore of vertue need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to move him to this, but he would do it even by his vicious nature, unles we ſhould hold it impoſſible that grace could be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of a miſdeed. The wicked ſpirits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any vertue at all have a moſt mean conceit of theſe ſublunary things, and why, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are of a Superiour nature and rank above them? What then ought man to do with vertue, who is elevated above all nature? If a great king in his robes of ſtate, ſhould find a ſpade or ſickle lying in the way, he would ſcorn to ſtoop to take it up, as being of a more eminent condition then a peaſant; and why doth man, when he hath once poſſeſſd his ſoul of Gods grace, ſtoop and debaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to earthly things, ſince his dignity over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops the heavens?</p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:39021:44"/>
                  <p> O how great is the excellency of grace! It lies conceald many times under a courſe and contemptible garment in a weak body, feeble, and ſometimes loathſome to the eye. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how much the nobleſt nature of a Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin ſurpaſſeth the baſeſt of a ſilly worme; yet ther is not the meaneſt ſlave and uglieſt Lepar if he be in the ſtate of grace, but doth much more exceed the nature of a higher Angel. If God ſhould create a ſelect nature in which all under-natures, vegetative, ſenſitive, rational &amp; Angelical were comprehended, in ſo much that theſe ſublime intelligences of the world Principalities, Dominations, Seraphins, were to acknowledg it of a Superiour Order as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures did Adam; what height of dignity would ſuch a one carry? But would it be decent thinke you, that ſuch a refind creature ſhould ſort himſelf with brute beaſts, &amp; in his carriage ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve to become like them? o man thou art exalted to a higher rank; while thou art in grace thou excelſt not only all created natures but alſo creable. How wouldſt thou wonder, if thou ſhouldſt ſee a deſpicable worme in a dead dog, become not only a glorious ſpirit, but equal even to the Seraphins: and why doſt thou not admire as much thy own elevation from ſin to a divine ſtate, which is far greater? Would a worme become a ſpirit covet to lodge in a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten carcaſs? &amp; why doſt thou love periſhable things, ſince thou art become after a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful manner &amp; priviledge a kind of God, &amp; a child of the increated God, who made thee by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:39021:45"/> a man, &amp; by redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, divine? Although thou ſeeſt not this dignity, thou muſt believe it, and frame a great conceit of thy ſelf more groundedly, then if thou beheldſt it with thy eyes. If all the perfection, excellency and beauty of all natures both exiſtent and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble were all collected into one, it were all nothing in compariſon of the leaſt particle of grace, which gives a ſoul preeminence above all preeminences, &amp; a beauty above all the beauties of nature. Thers no reſemblance betwixt God and all natural perfection; ſo he that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowd with grace exceeds all the good thats found in creatures; for he is in a divine degree.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe when thou wert yet in the abiſs of nothing &amp; God was about to give thee a being that he demanded of thee in what claſs thou wouldſt be created, whether a mere element, or a rock, or ſome piece of mettal, or a brute beaſt, or a man, or an Angel or one of the Seraphins? wouldſt thou not account this a great benefit? wouldſt thou chuſe to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible creature, or rather to be claſsd among the intelligible? or peradventure durſt thou hope and preſume to aſpire to the ſame divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne degree with God, ſurmounting all the afore mentiond natures? Behold how God hath of his own accord granted thee what thou durſt not ſo much as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceive in thought. He did not place thee among the formes of animated creatures, nor among the inanimate, nor among the unreaſonable, but rayſed thee not only to the degree of reaſon and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiality,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:39021:45"/> but even to a certain divine one. One man alone is more endebted to God for the leaſt degree of grace, then all creatures beſides from the Seraphins to the ſands of the ſea, for the creation of all other natures. Thou art more endebted to God for making thee partake of his nature by grace, then if he had made all created natures ſubordinate to thee, even from the Angels to the beaſts of the field.</p>
                  <p>All creatures are diſtributed into their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per files: the lower mix not with the higher; in animate things cannot attain to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the animate, living creatures fal ſhort of the ſenſitive, the ſenſitive of the intellectual, &amp; corporeal things of ſpiritual. The eye cannot know an Angel, they are of a different order; ſo nature ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not reach God in himſelf, he exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all created ſubſtances in a higher degree of diſproportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then ſpiritual things do ſenſitive. No body can operate after a divine manner unles he be in a divine ſtate: wherfore to know God in himſelf, and treat with him, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite we ſhould be eleuated to a higher or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der above nature, and plac'd in a ſupernatural: and grace effects this, carrying man beyond the bounds of nature, and ſetting him in a deifical ſtate and order, making him partaker of the divine nature, and by a wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and prerogative a kind of God. For man by grace partakes of God according to the higheſt degree of the divine nature, for as much as it exceeds all nature; not only as it is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:39021:46"/> exiſtent, living, knowing but as it is God and above all being, life, ſenſe, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. He partakes of the divine Eſſence in as much as it is above all eſſence, he partakes of the divine ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in as much as it is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial &amp; ſupereſſential: therfore a man in the ſtate of grace is above nature; above eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and all ſubſtances. If this prerogative were granted to one Angel or ſoul alone to be in the world and adornd with grace, though leſs then that wherewith an infant dying immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely after baptiſme is endowed, it would be lookt upon as a ſtupendious miracle, and no creature but would adore it. O my ſoul, how canſt thou but deem thy ſelf worthy of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, if thou humbly ſuſpect thy ſelf to be in grace? do not trouble thy ſelf for things that are below thee; and indeed all things are below thee.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding it is not the ſole prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of grace to excel all nature, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it makes man a child dear to God. O father, what a charity didſt thou beſtow upon us, that we both are, and are ſtild the Sons of God? we receive the Spirit which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opts children, that juſtifid by the grace of Chriſt we may be coheyres of IESVS, and thy inheritours. O that we could underſtand how great a dignity it is to become the Sons of God! men account it a great matter to be the allies or retayners of an earthly king; why make they not greater account of being the Sons and heyres of God? we are wont to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:39021:46"/> glory in the pedegree of men defunct, of the diſcent of fleſh and blood that ends in duſt, in our earthly parentage; but why do we not glory, in being in grace, in ſharing the nature of God, and ſuch a divine filiation? One that is of the blood-royall even afters divers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, is had in great eſteem by the world; how much more ought he that is a kin to God and allyd to him in the ſame nature.</p>
                  <p>A parent loves his child more affectionately then he doth another who is of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, of the ſame ſpeech and features, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he partakes of his nature; ſo God loves him who is in grace more te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derly then he doth the Angelical order, becauſe he ſhares with him in nature, though he be otherwiſe the moſt contemptible creature in the world. There is a larger difference betwixt the ſubſtance of a Cherubin conſiderd in it ſelf, &amp; one that is in grace, then there is betwixt a painted man &amp; the living original: although each creature par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of God in ſome ſort, yet there is a vaſt diſparity. They partake of his nature much after the manner of a picture; When a limmer drawes himſelf to life, the picture partakes of him by way of repreſentation in reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, in colour, in his lineaments, and all his exteriour; but not in the degree of life and a rational ſoul. All natures are ſo many rude draughts and expreſſions of ſome divine perfection, but without any part of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſpirit: he alone that is in grace, is a living image of God quickned with his ſpirit, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:39021:47"/> as it were the child and image of his parent by participation and communication of nature. What a deal of difference is there and how far falls a material picture or ſtatue of ſome king ſhort of the kings own beloved Son? the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt eſſence and natural perfection of the higheſt Archangel falls much ſhorter of a ſoul that is in grace: for there is no ſubſtance or nature but it repreſents God only after a dead manner, no otherwiſe then an Emperour is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by a piece of wood or marble or a painted tablet. Among thoſe that partake of the ſame nature there is not ſo much a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as an identity or ſelfſamenes: &amp; therfore the H. Fathers ſtile one that is in grace, the ſame with God, like as the father and the Son in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane generations are accounted the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The natural Son of God himſelf ſaid; let all be one, as thou o father in me and I in thee, that they may alſo be one in us. For although each juſt man, beſides the juſt of juſts IESVS, becomes only ſuch by adoption, there is a greater tye &amp; unity betwixt him &amp; God, then is found betwixt natural parents and their children. The children of men have only a ſmal parcel of baſe matter and their parents fleſh, but he that is in the degree of grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the whole divine ſpirit within him. Therfore the adoptive filiation of God is a more ſublime manner of filiation, then that which is naturally found among men.</p>
                  <p>O man rejoyce in this thy dignity, and do not degenerate from the divine condition
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:39021:47"/> thou art rayſd to: have a care of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, be zealous in his quarrel, if not becauſe he is thy God, at leaſt becauſe he is thy father and all that he hath ſhal be thine. Children becauſe they hope to inherit their fathers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony; follow their fathers buſines; thou being heir to God, muſt not carry thy ſelf like a ſtranger or alien. Although God had not given us our creation, yet for this only that he adopted us his children, we owe him a cordial love, and muſt diſcharge our duty in things appertaining to his ſervice with a great deal of zeal. O moſt loving father, why am not I touched with a deep reſentment for being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolld into thy family, and taſting ſo ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of thy providence. Wild beaſts out of love to their yong ones expoſe themſelves to a hazard of death; and what wilt thou do, who haſt given ſuch a remonſtrance of love even for us who condemnd thy natural Son, as to take us for thy children. O what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence ought a ſoul to have in this filiation! although God were not a God of providence, yet he would be watch fully careful &amp; ſweetly ſollicitous over him that is in grace: no les then a mother in widowhood over her only and beloved child; yea far greater then this is Gods affection and vigilancy in regard of the juſt.</p>
                  <p>To this we may add that by grace we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the friends of God. IESVS himſelf utterd theſe words ſweeter then honey drops; ye are my friends. For by grace there accrues
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:39021:48"/> a certain dignity betwixt God and man, not of a diſproportionable degree but ſo dignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it elevates him to the order of things divine; and of a mortal man makes him a friend and favorite of the immortal king. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we did not become the children of God, yet for this ſole reſpect, that grace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles us his beloved, its worth exceeds all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation. A friend is preferrd before a kins man, and is held more truſty then nature it ſelf: allies are often neglected or become the objects of hatred, friends are alwaies belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: men do more for their friend then for their brother: what then ſhal we conceive of friendſhip with God? There are two things which endear much, alliance and love, and both of them are found in grace. To be loved by God is a rich mine of heavenly gold, and a magazine of all divine bleſſings. The love of God is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oytering and ſluggiſh but moſt effectual and operative. To love one is to wiſh him wel: in God it is the ſelf ſame to wil and to do, and conſequently whomſoever he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth he enricheth him with the treaſures of heaven. The love of God is an ever flowing conduit or rather a river of celeſtial bleſſings. If he expoſd his life for his enemies what will he do for his friends? There is no incongruity or inconſequence to be found in God; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he did ſo much for thoſe that hated him, he wil do incredible things for thoſe that love him, carrying a ſpecial providence over them. If he have ſo much care of our
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:39021:48"/> enemies as to command us to love them, what wil he have of his own friends? He loved us ſo affectionately when we were yet his foes that he ſeemd to love us more then himſelf; and if he did this when we were his enemies, wil he do les when he both ſtiles and accounts us his friends?</p>
                  <p>Thou wouldſt be glad to have a friend as faithfull to thee as Ionathas was to David; but all humane fidelity is a meer toy, yea to be accounted but treachery, in regard of that which God ſhewes on thy behalf. Men hold it no ſmal favour to be taken notice of by a terrene king, what wil it be to be loved, &amp; ſo affectionately loved by God? wilt thou know, o my ſoul, how ſignally remarkable Gods friendſhip &amp; fidelity is? He is ſo enamourd upon his friends that he cannot endure to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them. If his immenſity were confind only to heaven, he would relinquiſh it to come to one that is in grace, nor would he ever be from him, but would make himſelf his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant ſejourner, that our ſociety may be with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; his Son Ieſus Chriſt by the mediation of the H. Ghoſt who is diffuſd in our harts. Deer and lambs and pigeons, are ſociable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they willingly ſort with one another, &amp; love thoſe whom they know to be of the ſame kind. God is ſociable, the Son of God is a lamb, the divine ſpirit is tame and affable, it loves thoſe that become divine, affecting the fellowſhip of his nature, and as it were of the ſame feather with him. If the moſt ſacred Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:39021:49"/> of Chriſt took ſuch complacence in any one as to be alwaies preſent with him, what ſhould we think of ſuch a ſingular privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg? and why do we not admire that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity never departs from the juſt man, but becomes his unſeparable companion? and not only dwels with him as his fellow ſejourner, but even in him, in whom he placeth his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle much more willingly then in the ſun.</p>
                  <p>What parent ſo loves his child, as with his good wil never to be from him, but alwaies in his company? yea ſuch a one aſſignes him a tutour and commits him to his cuſtody. But God our parent and friend entruſts us to no body elſe, he wil alwayes be with us himſelf. What mother loves her child ſo te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derly as that ſhe wil continually have him in her armes? Yet God doth this. Grace is a knot which tyes God and man together; it is the ſweet and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual embracement of the ſpirit divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. Among men the father may not be where the Son is, but God cannot but be with him that is in grace. Although God be exiſtent in creatures both by his eſſence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and power, this is ſo becauſe he is God, and it cannot be otherwiſe, not for any dignity or deſert in them, but by reaſon of his immenſity and infinitude. But grace not nature hath this attractivenes, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God could be abſent, and were limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to locality, yet it would make him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and exiſtent with one in grace, reſiding with him, and becoming one ſpirit: yea albeit
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:39021:49"/> he could forget his creatures, he would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſweetly preſent to his memory, &amp; ſhare of his providence; although he could relinquiſh them, and not operate in them nor conſerve &amp; maintain them, yet he would ſtil be working ſome good in the juſt: for as love is effectual, ſo it never intends any good but it compleats it.</p>
                  <p>What a benefit and dignity is it to have God alwaies for our companion? certainly we ſhould be ſtruck with amazement to ſee any creature ſo beloved by God, and ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he commanded his celeſtial ſpirits thoſe thouſands of thouſands that attend him, to accompany it whether ſoever it went, and be followd by all that traine ſo ſtately and majeſtical: yet this would be but ſolitude in compariſon of the fellowſhip and attendance of God. What are all things before thee, o lord, but as it were a mere nothing and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity? If we ſhould admire ſuch a creature, why do we not alſo admire a ſould in grace, ſince it hath God for its attendance, not wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at its elbow, but as it were in its eſſence enlivening it: O moſt fortunate dignity of man and dignation of God, to have that higheſt Majeſty alwaies accompanying the Sons of men! for God will not be a lazy and unprofitable companion to a ſoul, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding what is beho offul to it. Wil he be like one that is ſluggiſh or blind, who neither ſees nor reſents the neceſſities and miſeries which preſs it? certainly God doth not aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate himſelf to the juſt for nothing. They
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:39021:50"/> may wel neglect both themſelves and their temporal, if only they be careful of what concerns him: he wil have a care of them. O my Father, o friend, o companion! I beg of thy Majeſty, that I may alwaies carry a due reverence, fidelity, and affability to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee: I wil demean my ſelf to thee as a child doth to his parent, taking all thy affaires to hart, reputing them my own: not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then towardly children are induſtriouſly careful of their parents buſines, becauſe they look upon it as their own. I beſeech thee that I may be a faithful friend to thee, ſeeking at all turnes thy greater honour &amp; glory, advancing what concerns thee &amp; loving thee more then my ſelf. Grant that I may keep with thee all the rules of good fellowſhip, leaſt by my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual defects I may contriſtate thy holy ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>But if all grace be of ſuch vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in it ſelf, that it makes us kinſmen and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of God, moſt dear to him, yea in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Gods, and this becauſe it is given by Chriſt; hence it followes, that that portion of it which befals man, is more happy, more vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and highlyer priviledgd then that which was beſtowd upon the Angels, or our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the ſtate of innocency. Thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are ordinarily firſt in their parents affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who were deliverd into the world with the ſtrongeſt throwes of a hard labour: and what wonder then, if our grace be dearer to Chriſt ſince it coſt him ſo many ſorrowes, and he for it beſtow on us greater priviledges, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:39021:50"/> us more helps, tolerating us more patiently and longanimouſly, rayſing us to great ſpiritual advancement; in ſo much that the very Angels themſelves do honour men for this reſpect that they have grace by Chriſt, &amp; are ſtruck with a reverential fear to ſee our nature now proſtrate before them, which they ſleighted ſo much before God became Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate by aſſuming it; and this, becauſe a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial dignity accrues to the grace we partake of, we being made therby living members of Chriſt &amp; computed the ſame with him. There redounds a certain veneration from the head to the members: how can the Angels deſpiſe our nature, which they admiringly behold exalted above theirs, even to the throne of the Divinity and fellowſhip of God? what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they treat us not as their inferiours whome the Son of God the firſt begotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many brethren, under the title of equals, exalted above the celeſtial ſpirits themſelves, calling men his brethren and eſteeming them more then Angels. He never honored any of the Seraphins ſo much as to call him brother. This is the higheſt prerogative of grace which renders it ſo honorable, and elevates it above all nature. Moreover our nature it ſelf, by grace through Chriſt is dignified and exalted above all other natures, for as much as the Lord of glory communicates the ſame his glory with his joyntly united members and living allyes. Our grace alſo is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the merits of IESVS and his union, as if
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:39021:51"/> therby it gave us a juſter title to merit from God, and makes us do it after a perfecter man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For we are all children of ſorrow, we are Gods Benjamins the Sons of his right hand, and dear above all, others. O moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving father, who ſacrificd they only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son to death, that I becoming thy Son might live, grant that I may alwayes have a true eſteem and knowledg of this ineſtimable benefit. One Angel is more endebted to thee for the leaſt degree of grace which he received then all creatures together for all the goods of nature and creation of the univerſe. But I a ſilly wretched man, owe thee more for the leaſt particle of grace beſtowd upon me, then all the Hierachies of Angels for all the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural guifts conferrd upon them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For to the end that I through grace might live a divine life, thou wouldſt have thy ſon in humane nature to ſuffer an unha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane death. Thou haſt done more for me then for all the Angels; thou haſt heapd more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligations upon me then upon the Cherubins and Seraphins.</p>
                  <p>There are two reaſons for which men are obligd to preſerve and highly magnify divine grace. The one is its ineſtimable worth and unſpeakable dignity; the other is thy moſt pretious blood, o IESVS, which thou didſt ſhed to merit grace. If we be not ſatisfyd of its value in its ſelf, this may throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that thou wouldſt purchaſe it for us at ſo deare a rate. It muſt needs be a rare
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:39021:51"/> and ſtupendious thing, which God who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err in his choiſe choſe rather to give us then ſave the life of his own Son ſo pretious to him.</p>

                  <p>THorns conſerve plants in a garden, &amp; auſterities grace in a juſt man. A freſh vigour of mind flouriſheth many times in a tottering and witherd body. That Phyſitians may cure the body, they more and more afflict it by bitter potions, by abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, by breathing a veine, by ſearing it, and other wayes yet more penal: if it be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of thee to afflict it in ſome ſort for the good of thy ſoul, no great matter is demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He that is ill at eaſe amidſt his gripes and paines caſts up what annoyd him: ſo the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant humours of our ſoul, are not purgd by living pleaſantly, ſince the maladies of our bodies are not curd without annoiance. A flint being beaten yealds flaſhes of light, and the fleſh by chaſtiſements illuminates the mind. That ſoul ſhewes it ſelf a very beaſt, which treats not its body like a beaſt. Even as affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and croſſes ſent by God, make men relent, think upon him, indoctrinate them enkindle fervour, increaſe familiarity with
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:39021:52"/> God, and raiſe their harts; ſo voluntary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities have like effect; they make man have a more frequent recourſe to God, and being voyd of ſenſible guſt they diſpoſe him better for divine illuſtrations.</p>
                  <p>The curbing of nature is a fit diſpoſition for increaſe of grace: this is the ayme and endeavour of grace to divorce us from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, corporeal, and viſible things; and a penitential life finds this half done to its hand, ſuppoſing it be accompanyd with divine grace, without which nothing is beneficial to us, nothing profitable. The depth of our humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation together with bodily auſterity is the throne and kingdom of grace, and a ſtep to glory; and the crucifying of our fleſh, the exalting of the ſpirit. Thou armeſt thy ſelf with voluntary afflictions againſt neceſſary ones, learning thus in the ſchool of patience how thou art to embrace thoſe which are ſent thee from God. By theſe skirmiſhes thou art taught to overcome thy ſelf, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſable thy greateſt antagoniſt by whom the reſt aſſaile thee; thou alſo findeſt a more ſpeedy redreſſ at the hands of God in thy addreſſes to him. Although Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyd be a ſufficient warrant for our penitential auſterities, yet we might ſpecify many more and principally our innumerable defaults and penalties due for them, that we may make amends for what is paſt, and leſſen future miſdemeanours. Thy ſoul muſt be the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of thy fleſh; for this end through
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:39021:52"/> the great mercy of God, it is repriev'd and reſcued from the paines of hel fire. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it happens that of two criminals ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencd to death the one partner is quitted upon this condition that he execute the ſentence of death upon his companion, becoming his hangman for want of another. Our ſoul and body are joynt ſharers in ſin, let the ſoul be the executioner of divine juſtice over the body, and puniſh it in a due manner, ſhe when ſhe firſt ſinned being repriev'd from eternal damnation.</p>
                  <p>Suffer nothing to paſs unpuniſhed: make thy ſelf formidable to thy ſelf, as one that can be cruel againſt thy ſelf, a moſt impartial and ſevere chaſtizer of all the delinquencies and ſoothings of the fleſh: all muſt undergoe their due penalty. There's no citty wel go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernd, unles its penal lawes be in force and vigour; nor can that conſcience be wel orderd, where ſo many depraved affections are on foot without its courts and ſword of juſtice. The puniſhment thou inflicteſt upon thy ſelf muſt be correſponding to thy fault: beware God call thee not to an account for contemning &amp; corrupting juſtice. Take pennyworths of thy ſelf, both becauſe thou pleadeſt guilty, &amp; haſt playd the naughty judge in acquitting thy ſelf ſo often by being indulgent to thy ſelf. Iuſtice is exerciſd in cityes rather to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify others by ſuch an example from offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then to leſſen the guilt and puniſhment of him that is nocent: but thou reapeſt more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:39021:53"/> fruit by chaſtizing thy ſelf; thou ſhalt not onely henceforth deter others from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending but thy ſelf, that thou mayſt not commit new ones, and diminiſh the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due for the committed. Thy ſeverity is not a piece of juſtice but indulgence; for mans revenge works Gods pardon. Yet in all thy proceedings be mindful how prayſe worthy is obedience, and how profitable diſcretion, leaſt thou practiſe auſterity unadviſedly, with decreaſe of thy own profit, and les increaſe of Gods honour and ſervice; for the divel is ready to catch at all turnes. Nevertheles be careful above all and at all times, rather to chaſtize thy will then thy body: but as far as a prudent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection diveſted of ſelf love, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of thy ſuperiour with regard to each ones age, condition, ſtrength, inclination, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and neceſſity ſhal permit ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities, thou muſt without mercy and ſelf-flattery not be ſparing in inflicting them.</p>
                  <p>O mercyful truth, how can I flatter and pamper my ſelf, if I call to mind the hardſhip and torments which my moſt innocent IESVS ſufferd for my ſins, and the paines that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by the ſoules in Purgatory. It would be accounted a huge priviledge, if God ſhould permit a ſoule in thoſe ſcorching flames to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem its ſufferings, as we now may, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing voluntary afflictions. Let us now make uſe of this his indulgence. If a creditour ſhould remit to one a debt of a hundred ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents upon this condition, if within a prefixt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:39021:53"/> time he payd him only one, would he, think you, refuſe ſo gainful a bargain. What a madnes is it in us to chuſe rather to pay a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the other life then one in this? But what need of remiſſion of theſe terrifical pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? the gracefulnes and beauty which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to our fleſh in the life to come is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient incentive.</p>
                  <p>Remember how glorious and ſeemly our bodies will be in the future reſurrection: which ſhal ſhare of comelines and ſplendour accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rate and proportion of their now-preſent ſufferances. The robes which are to veſt them in eternity are woven by the home ſpun &amp; temporal afflictions of this life. Some not to appear deformed to the eyes of men have ſufferd their limbs and bones to be cut and rackd half the tearm of their ſhort life: eternal beauty is purchaſd at a far eaſier rate; it is not requird that we cut them, but only that we do not pamper them, &amp; a litle vex &amp; annoy them. Our H. Patriarch S. Ignatius underſtood this excellently wel; who being not as yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to almighty God, to avoid deformity commanded a bone to be cut out, enduring the pain without a tear, without a ſigh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſign of grief or torture; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his converſion, he judgd it an act far more heroical, upon conſideration of a future co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melines, that is to inveſt us in the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to undergoe auſterities, to faſt for whole weeks together, to diſciplin himſelf thrice a day, to make prolix genuflexions, lying on
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:39021:54"/> the bare ground, wearing a rough hair-ſhirt, clad in ſackcloth, going barefoot, treating his body in the harſheſt manner he could both for apparrel and rigour of fare. The auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities alſo of barbarous hethens deſtitute of our hopes may make us bluſh at our own te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity: they wore ſhirts of iron, which goard their bodies on all ſides with ſharp pricks; they ſhretchd themſelves upon tenter hooks ſinging the whilſt hymnes in praiſe of their God; they caſt themſelves under the wheeles of the chariots which carried their Idols and ſufferd themſelves to be bruizd to pieces; they abſtaind from meat for many dayes together.

The ſoul ought to renounce her own fleſh which ſhe animates, and why doth ſhe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately love anothers, and that void of life, which ſervd others, and perchance ſerves now only for food and lodging for wormes. The noblenes of grace and our alliance with Chriſt ſhould in all reaſon be forcible enough to make us forget and bluſh at our nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out needing the incentives of its baſenes, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and loſs of allies.</p>
                  <p>O divine truth, thou commandeſt me to hate my kindred that I may become thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; If I love them more then thee, how ſhal I become thy ſpirit, adhering to thee, one ſpirit with thee? Grant me by thy blood that I may not love my blood but in thine: let the blood of Chriſt obtain ſo much at our hands, that we love not too much the blood of ſinful men. Chriſt by his ſacred blood would redeem us, and become our allie by blood; for he was not ignorant of the tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and defects of our blood and our allies by blood, and therfore vouchſafed a repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirit is not bound to follow the lawes and dictamens of the fleſh: ſee then o my ſoul, that neernes of blood do not taint thy love. God commands thee to hate thy ſelf and thy own fleſh and blood, how canſt thou then love thy friends and kinsfolks otherwiſe then for

Thou mightſt with as much reaſon love gnats or flies as thy allies, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles thou ſeek'ſt to deſtroy. Wormes are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genderd by the ſame carnal parents with thy brethren; why adhor'ſt thou them with ſuch a loathing of ſtomack more then all, and loveſt thy kindred with ſuch affection of hart more then God? If the ground of this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary love beyond the dictamens of vertue, be, for that they are engendred of the ſame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: wormes have more from them then thy brethren, for they gave not theſe their ſoul, nor are they totally producd by them; as the others are. Hence kinsfolks and parents love and regard only the bodies of their kindred, being little ſollicitous for what concerns the good of their ſoul; it being Gods handywork not theirs. Yea neither didſt thou receive thy body from thy parents, but by them from God. What? loveſt thou thy allies becauſe they are parts of thy common progenitours? by the ſame reaſon thou oughteſt to love any of their diſſeverd members yea though infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a loathſome canker.

If diveſted of all thou be pleaſing to God and he pleaſd with thee, to what purpoſe ſeekeſt thou by the acceſs of creatures and cares to become gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teful to him.

Why art thou afraid to become poor, if thou canſt carry a kingdom in thy hart? The kingdom of God is within you.</p>
                  <p>O ridiculous cauſe of teares which takes away the cauſes of ſin! it is a high piece of impudence againſt God, to grieve and lament at the loſs of temporal things, which we ought to have in hatred. A woman though never ſo much a harlot hides the griefe and teares which ſhe ſheds for the loſſes and injuries of the adulterer, ſhe conceales alſo the joy ſhe takes in his preſence: thou even to Gods face rejoyceſt in the proſperity of thoſe things with which thou playeſt the naught; thou art ſorry for their loſs, and dareſt ask of him either that he take them not away, or els reſtore them. What woman ſurprizd in adultery durſt beg of her husband, that he would not interrupt that unlawful pleaſure, when ſhe ſhould rather beg pardon for the offence? Her husband would deale mercifully with her, if he only took away the adulterer; and how ſhameles art thou who deemſt it an injury? what wife could be ſo impudent as to ſay to her husband, bring me that Blackamore that I may enjoy his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements, for I like him better then thee:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:39021:57"/> &amp; thou dareſt be ſo frontleſs as to make God the pandar of thy diſorderly concupiſcence by begging temporal things of him. When thou askeſt any thing of God beſides God, thy very prayer betrayes thy adulterous ſpirit: for it is the ſelfſame as if thou ſhouldſt ſay give me, o Lord, ſomething wherwith to offend thee. It is bad enough to play the fornicatour to his diſhonour, without begging of him the increaſe of that ſtore, by whoſe fruition thou undoes thy ſelf; and ſuch is the preſervation of riches, honours, guſts, colours, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal beauties.</p>
                  <p>He that were peſterd with a loath ſome canker would not be offended with the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgian for lancing the infected part, but of his own accord would profer it to be cut of, though with grief and horrour: but if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance waking out of his ſleep, he ſhould find it done to his hand imperceptibly, and without any concurrence of his own, he would eſteem it a miraculous cure, and render thanks to God for it as ſuch. Thou art not depriud of thy joints and limbs but hurtful darts which poyſon thy hart; give God thanks that this privation is made unſenſibly and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to thy patience. Thou who ſhouldſt relinquiſh all, do not grieve at the loſs of ſome. To make them a matter of merit, thou ſhouldſt give them to the poor; if God take them why takeſt't thou it not patiently?

I will not, o Lord, have my ſelf, that I may have thee. If many Philoſophers depriv'd themſelves of all theſe goods for love of themſelves, becauſe they held them baſe and great hindrances to their courſe of life, what do I, who for love of thee repine to be depriud but of ſome?</p>
                  <p>O feeble ſpirit, why grieveſt thou to be circumciſd in a few ſuperfluous things, ſince indeed a few only are neceſſary. What do I ſay a few? Nothing but God is neceſſary to me. I congratulate with my ſelf; God is my ſufficiency who knowes no deficiency. I knew not, o ſweet truth, what a comfortable thing it was to have nothing; yea to know more clearly then the ſunſhine, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together impoſſible, although I endeavoured it never ſo much, to have any thing beſides God, which can be mine and not Gods alone.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:39021:58"/> But becauſe all things are his, and he mine, all things are mine, and then moſt mine, when I have them leaſt, becauſe they have me leaſt, and I have them better in God, then if I had them in themſelves. If I were truly humble, I ſhould not grieve at the loſs of temporal things: He that is to eſteem himſelf nothing, how can he eſteem other things ſome thing, which are baſer then himſelf. When one dies all things die to him; ſo he that deems himſelf nothing, deems the whole world nothing All things are dead to one that is dead, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to one truly humble.</p>

                  <p>HOw canſt thou expect to be crownd if thou doſt not combat? and how wilt thou combat, if thou be not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted and tempted? Without an enemy there is no combat; and without a combat there is no victory. Nay it were diſgraceful and litle to our credit, to be crownd without fighting, to triumph without a victory, and challenge or uſurp an honour not due to us; therfore do not take it ill, that thou art vext with temptations, for there is the ſtore houſe of merit, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of humbling thy ſelf. God hath permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many to fal into grievous ſins, that they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:39021:58"/> might become humble: he dealt more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with thee, permitting thee only to be tempted. Reſiſt valiantly in Gods quarrel: although it be troubleſome enough, in the very conflict and aſſault of temptations, to fight and make reſiſtance, yet the victory over it, is more delectable then the pleaſure of the ſin to which it drawes thee. Thou muſt not compare the ſweetnes of the ſin, with the noyſomenes of the temptation, but with the joy that ariſeth from the victory; nor the combat with the pleaſure, but the fruit of the victory with the practiſe of the vice. Try a litle what it is to overcome temptations, who haſt tryd ſo often what it is to be overcome by them.</p>
                  <p>When thou prevaileſt, think that eer long thou art to fight again: when thou fighteſt, think that in that victory the enemy is to be totally routed, and thou to enjoy an eternal peace. Perchance in part it will ſo fall out: for the divel put to confuſion and flight wil not dare to aſſaile thee again, and God wil give thee ſome truce, as he knows it expedient for thy good. He who permitted it for thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, knowes at what time it is beſt to free thee. An artificer takes not gold out of the furnace til it be purgd ſufficiently: and if thou be not purifyd enough and improved, he wil not free thee from that moleſtation. In time of victory be mindful of the combat, in time of the combat of victory. Thou ſhalt be in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual joy if thou overcome, in perpetual ſhame if overcome: why doſt thou miſprize
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:39021:59"/> the ſecure joy and integrity of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for a vain and momentary delight? All the time of this life is loſt, which is not ſpent in ſuffering. Do not refuſe the trouble of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, ſince thou muſt not expect, ſo long as thou liveſt here, to be without ſome trouble. What ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of life ſoever thou embraceſt ſtill muſt thou undergoe ſome afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; chuſe then to be afflicted for vertue. No place is exempted from all annoiance and contrariety; but it is a happy one and eaſy to be born, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone for the purchaſe of eternal happines. Even for humane ends, we ſuſtain a longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, with greater expenſe of labour, and leſs fruit. The tearm of our temporal labours concludes in a new lab our, and that many ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes an eternal one; but this other, as light and ſhort as it is, works in thee an everlaſting poize of glory, to which all the ſufferings of this time bear no proportion at all. At leaſt wiſe take this tribulation not repiningly, which thou oughtſt to wiſh for, out of a thirſt of greater glory, which will increaſe, when it is waterd with that fire. Yea although noe reward were allotted for it, it is enough that therby thou art more conformable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt. Great neceſſity forceth thee to fight valiantly and make reſiſtance: thou art under the eyes of thy judge, and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt a quarrel, in which his honour lies at ſtake, the Saints and Angels being ſpectatours. Thou muſt reſolve rather to dye a thouſand deaths then once be vanquiſhd, and put to the ſhame
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:39021:59"/> of ſuffering a foyle. How dareſt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery in the preſence of thy ſpouſe, the Hierachies of Angels looking on, and quires of Saints being eye witneſſes of ſuch diſloyalty.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be, but that thou muſt often be annoid and tempted in this life; wherfore look well to thy ſelf and ſtand upon thy guard: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou haſt built in thy ſelf a caſtle ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſtrong, and fencd it with the ramparts of all vertues, expect temptations, becauſe it is founded upon thy own nature, together with the weak and frail infirmity of thy fleſh. What availes it to the ſecurity of a houſe that its wals are very ſtrong and made of ſtone, if it have a ruinous foundation? what imports it that thou art armd from head to foot, if thou ſtand upon ſlippery ground, or ride upon a boggling, unruly, and head ſtrong horſe? wel mayſt thou furniſh thy ſelf with vertues; but ſtil thou art environd with fleſh, which is more dangerous then a reſty and untractable iade, and more unſtable then ſand, unles it be ſolidated in the grace of God. Wherfore the moſt univerſal remedy, and effectualleſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote againſt temptations, is to diſpoyl thy ſelf of thy nature, as much as thou canſt, with its appetites, to extirpate al ſelf-ſeeking intereſts, and become ſincere and untainted with the leaſt blemiſh of thy own wil: for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is tempted by his own concupiſcence. When we ſeek temptation we ſhal find it. He that ſeeks himſelf wil find himſelf: and what
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:39021:60"/> wilt thou find in thy ſelf, who art ſo wretched, but wretchednes, trouble, and affliction.</p>

                  <p>OVr enemy lays his ſnares on all ſides; there's no part of our life free from danger, but the greateſt of all is our own ſecurity, for that comprizeth all dangers.

How canſt thou beſecure, ſince thou art thy own foe, and haſt all the world oppoſite to thee, and all the divels at a deadly feud with thee? If ten men ſhould come againſt one, if twice as great an army aſlail a General, he would fear, were he never ſo valiant; and why art not thou a fraid ſince no les then the whole world is an enemy to thee, and fights againſt thee?</p>
                  <p>Thou muſt alſo fear God, both becauſe thou haſt offended him, and mayſt offend him hereafter. What woman taken in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, if her husband let no word of pardon fall, could chuſe but be in fear and ſuſpenſe? thou alſo muſt be ſo, for thou knoweſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that thou haſt ſinnd, but thou haſt no evidence nor revelation that it is pardond; neither ſhouldſt thou covet to have, becauſe an humble fear and ſollicitude wil benefit thee
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:39021:60"/> more then ſuch a favour from heaven. For as thoſe that fear, are wont to be thirſty, ſo a holy fear of God wil procure a thirſt &amp; more earneſt deſire of pleaſing and ſerving him in all things. But if thou haſt not ſinnd, or wert by ſome revelation from God ascertaind of pardon, yet for all that ceaſe not to fear: ſome after they have wrought many miracles, and lead a moſt holy &amp; auſtere life for divers yeares in the wildernes, have miſcarried miſerably. The Angels in heaven, Adam in paradiſe, Saul and Iudas who were choſen by God before ſo many others, ſufferd at length a lamentable ſhipwrack. Heron after he was arrived to a high pitch of perfection and eminent vertue; after labours, ſweats, abſtinences, and many other prodigious things (for he eat but once in 3. months ſpace, and then only a wood ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad, refraining in the interim from all food, beſides the moſt ſacred Body of Chriſt our Lord) falling at length moſt lamentably, he haunted taverns, becoming firſt a drunkard, and afterwards luxurious. Thou art in the vale of ſinners, nor wilt thou pretend that thou art elected by God, nor art thou conſcious to thy ſelf of ſo rare ſanctity, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary that thou art a ſinner: how then art thou not afraid of thy ſelf, why doſt thou not ſtand in dread of God? The Angels and Seraphins do tremble, though they know themſelves ſecure both from ſin and damnation, becauſe they ſee a poſſibility only of ſome creatures being damned; why doſt not thou tremble
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:39021:61"/> ſince thy damnation is alſo poſſible?</p>
                  <p>God permits many great Saints to fal, to teach thee that all proceeds from him, and that we muſt not preſume and confide in our own merits and diligence, but in him alone. Thou haſt no reaſon to rely upon thy ſelf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thy merits be not inferiour to thoſe of Saint Iohn Baptiſt, but on God thou mayſt, though as deſperately wicked as Antichriſt; and how frequent and enormous ſoever thy miſdemeanours are, thou haſt no reaſon at all to diſpaire or be dejected, but muſt truſt ſo much the more in God, by how much thou haſt les reaſon to truſt in thy ſelf. This is true divine hope when a man confides not at all in himſelf; the more he feares God, the more wil he truſt in him. S. Proſper ſaid very wel:
<q>
                        <l>He that from feares himſelf wil free</l>
                        <l>God muſt his Sanctuary be.</l>
                     </q> How much more juſt any one is, and how much more enamoured upon God, ſo much more anxious is he with fear: for he knowes how much he deſerves to be loved &amp; reverened; inſomuch that a man ought to wiſh and beg to be in torments through all eternity, that ſo he might in ſome ſort be thankful to him for ſo great goodnes; but becauſe the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his defects makes him fal far ſhort of ſuch deſires, he is ſiezd with no ſmal fear, he not doing what he ought and might do; and for that reaſon he is afraid leaſt he looſe God, which renders him ſo much more anxious, by
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:39021:61"/> how much he knowes him more worthy of love.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheles the anchour of his hope, muſt be caſt in him that created him, as wel in great as little fluctuations of the mind. Our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the moſt part failes in this, that in great affaires it flies to God, as if in ſmal ones we were able to do ſome what of our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves. As we lin petty as waighty matters, we muſt place our ſole hope in him, becauſe we are wholly impotent of our ſelves to do any good. Some faulter becauſe they can hope for mean things, but dare not extend it to greater, either becauſe they hold themſelves unworthy, or elſe for that they frame two meane a conceit of Gods excellency, and the merits of IESVS. What makes thee doubt or be diſmaid in the purſuit of vertu and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſanctity, as if grace were to be obtaind by thy own ſtrength and deſerts, or God were of an envious, or covetous, or needy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition? The arme of God and not thy forces enable thee to follow vertue. God is bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent, he envies not thy good. His divine riches are ſo priviledgd, that to be liberal, it is not requird he ſhould be good and a lover of us, he looſeth nothing when he gives, he improveriſheth not his exchequer and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, he doth not leſſen his ſtock but au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gments it. If any man had a treaſure of that nature, were he never ſo miſerly and hide bound, he would not deny what were askd; but the more covetous he were, the more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:39021:62"/> bountiful would he be, and would take it for an affront, if a trifle were demanded. Who is ſo ill naturd as to deny light, although he had never ſeen one ask it before; and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by giving it he looſeth nothing, his light remaining as intirely to himſelf as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. Why ſhal not we without preſumption expect ſuch a liberality from the father of lights, from whom each beſt guift diſcends? We injure the Divinity by not hoping from ſo good a God &amp; our father, what one might hope from the worſt of men though a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian unknown to us. Do not doubt of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thy requeſt, he hath promiſd far more then thou requireſt. Do not miſtruſt his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he hath done ſtranger things then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. He promiſed thee his kingdom; but he became a ſervant for thee; he promiſd that thou ſhouldſt live with him, but he ſufferd death for thy ſake: it is more wonderful that God died &amp; became a ſervant, then that man ſhould live &amp; raign in glory: now then we have a pledge, which is an aſſurd one. Wherfore ſometimes thou doſt not ſo much purely truſt in God as tacitly preſume of thy ſelf, when thy hope pitcheth but upon ſome things, and thoſe not great, nor all. Of thy ſelf thou art as impotent in order to ſmal things as great, but in God equally powerful to both.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, how fondly proceeds he who hopes not great matters from thee? for what in reſpect of man is but hope, in reſpect of thee, is wiſh and deſire. If one, o my ſoul,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:39021:62"/> ſhould deſire thee to do a thing, and again and again intreat thee, and offer his aſſiſtance, and for that end out of the ardour of his deſire ſhould expoſe his life to manifeſt danger: if thou at length hadſt a mind to do it, and now nothing were wanting but his concurrence, who had ſo long and earneſtly ſought and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourd it; wouldſt thou not go to him with an aſſurd confidence of having redreſs, and beg his aſſiſtance, eſpecially if he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſd it. This is our caſe with God, whom thou muſt importune with winning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, and a ful confidence of reliefe. On his ſide there is no cauſe of fearing a repulſe: how can it be that he will deny, what he ſo earneſtly deſires ſhould be asked. Doſt thou expect to be heard, God expects that thou cry to him. Fear him alone, becauſe of thy ſelf thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver art ſecure in this life ſo beſet with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Although one lead never ſo holy and vertuous a life, he ſhall not want entrapments: for the divel impugnes ſuch with greater ſpleen and malice, becauſe their manner of life is ſo very conſpicuous: A thief will rather ſteal pearles and pretious ſtones then peebles or flints. God permits theſe dangers for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of humility: for this life being moſt pretious, he wil have it moſt humble. He permits us to be ſo many wayes aſſaulted, that we may ſtil have dependance on him, and ſo be moſt ſafe when we think ourſelves leaſt ſafe, and remain ſo ſtil by truſting in him, if we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver venture to preſume of our ſelves. In this
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:39021:63"/> manner, dangers render our life ſecure; thus by fearing only God, thou quitſt thy ſelf of all fear; and if thou fearſt him only, thou ſhalt more confidently hope all things from him: Hope &amp; fear of God are two admirable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions: they extremely help one another, &amp; thou muſt never forſake them; they wil help thee not a litle, if in thee they help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for one without the other wil litle avail either thee or it ſelf, yea of times proves very prejudiciall.</p>

It was truly ſaid by one, that it was a wonder all the ſtones under the feet of thoſe who are to be damnd are not turnd into roſes, ſo to mitigate the miſeries they are to ſuffer. But on the contrary, it is more to be wonderd that under the feet of thoſe who are to be ſaved, they are not changd into thornes, and leaping from thence upon their heads, do not puniſh them for their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; ſuch unſpeakable fruit ſhal they reap of their ſo ſhort labour.</p>
                  <p>What is the reaſon, ſince Chriſts redemption is moſt copious, that it took away ſin, and would not alſo take away thoſe annoinances which in this life ariſe from ſin, but becauſe afflictions are beneficially ſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tiferous. How ſhould we ever aſpire to eternal life, if this
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:39021:64"/> momentary were pleaſant and caſeful, ſince we now love it, though ful of miſeries, and conceive but remiſs deſires of the others bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. That bleſſed and elevated man F. Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tazar Alvarez ſaid very well, that tribulations are ſo many wingd horſes to carry us a main pace towards heaven. How much the more we debar our ſenſes of their delights by ſuffering, ſorrowing, or ſicknes, ſo much the more are we forced to fly to God, and ſeek true goods in heaven. The tops of trees if the under branches be cut away reare themſelves much higher; and our mind by depreſſing and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſe under, flouriſheth and taketh better growth. After the lapſe of Adam God found out the rare invention of ſuffering, a heavenly deviſe againſt ſin. An invention worthy of God was labour and affliction, that we might be in our body as if we were bodiles, and by that meanes our relliſh might be the purer, our mind being diſaffected to ſenſe, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the fleſh, that by ſuffering it might be preſervd from all contagion by its paſſions and deſires. It is a heavenly deviſe to ſupply the commodity and prerogative of death, that we may not be taken with theſe fading &amp; ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things. Patience was extolld by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, becauſe they eſteemd ſuffering, which it mitigates, an evil: but becauſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering is extreme good, therfore I ſay that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is good, it making us not ſhun, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in what is good.</p>
                  <p>God is neither ignorant nor unwiſe (far be
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:39021:64"/> ſuch a blaſphemy from us) but the refinedſt wiſdome; nevertheles he choſe afflictions for his beſt-beloved Son, he choſe them for his Mother; for the Apoſtles companions of his Son, and others his friends. That zealous and devout Father Chriſtopher Rodriguez was wont to ſay; that he would have no body to compaſſionate him in his ſorrowes and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, but rather congratulate and jointly with him give thanks to God: for as one friend ſhakes hands with another and preſſingly wrings them in token of friendſhip, til they ake again; ſo God with his hand preſſeth his friends and wrings them, which is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſignal love. Puniſhments many times are greater tokens of benevolence then guifts and benefits, becauſe in that caſe the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themſelves are the greateſt favours and moſt beneficial. Reprehenſion and chaſtize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a more pregnant ſigne of charity then indulgence and cockering. One benevolous to foraigners and aliens wil be found more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily then a reprover and rebuker; but chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zement is only uſd towards friends and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiques. Indulgence and liberality extend themſelves even to enemies; correction only to children and familiars: wherfore the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of this life are ſurer pledges of love then the favours of fortune.</p>
                  <p>Tribulations are not alwaies the penalty of delinquency: although no fault precede they are good; and do thou beare them patiently, whether they be inflicted immediately by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:39021:65"/> God or by men, and take them ſo much more joyfully, by how much leſs thou ſeemſt to have deſervd them. Even as we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce much more if God afflict us, and not for our ſins; ſo ought we alſo to be more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and joyful, when we are perſecuted, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd, and revild by men, if we be conſcious of our own innocency, and that we ſuffer without deſert. What croſs wouldſt thou rather chuſe, and with whome to dye? with the theives on theirs, or with Chriſt on his, The thieves croſſes had their merits, they were pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhd for their ſins: but the croſs of Chriſt was a croſs of innocency, it was not erected for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency, that were horrid blaſphemy; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou muſt glory in no croſs but that of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Our nature fel &amp; in its fal it loſt its rectitude and uprightnes; it muſt be repaird, renewd, and rectifyd, by hard and heavy duties. The hammer is hard and heavy, but it moulds and faſhions pieces of plate, which it makes beautiful to the eye, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies what was crooked and amiſs.</p>
                  <p>Tribulation carries a kind of divine autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a long with it, in ſo much that the H. Ghoſt breaths more effectually many-times by it then by the Prophets and H. Scriptures. We are ſometimes refractory to the word of God, and the good admonitions of H. Fathers and Doctours; but tribulations, I know not how, make God when he ſpeaks, be ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded, that without any more ado we yeald &amp; obey.

                     </gap>bids ſilence and gaines his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory; ſo God ſtriking with his, makes us attentive to what he ſayes. Pharao reſiſted him ſpeaking by his ſervant Moyſes; he became plyable and obedient, when he afflicted him by any contemptible creature. The people would not hearken to Ieremy, til captivity at length made them relent. No body is deaf nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate to tribulation: it is Gods eloquence and the chaire of the H. Ghoſt. it is a ſacred thing, and as it were the Altar and throne of God, although harſh and repugnant to fleſh and blood. O how awfull and terrible is that place! but in very deed, it is no other then the house of God and gate of heaven, the ſanctuary of vertues, whether we fly from vice, as into a ſacred place of refuge.</p>
                  <p>Go to then, o ſoul dear to Chriſt, fly not affliction as if it were venimous: it cannot hurt thee; thy IESVS hath already taſted it; it is neither evil nor untoothſome, when God is there to ſeaſon it: how can the bitternes of a drop of gal be perceivd in an Ocean of hony? whatſoever God ſends, or howſoever he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of me, I ſhall never want this comfort, that it is pleaſing to him. Let this be a ſolid comfort to thee; and yet if thou ſuffer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comfort do not ſhun it. Let it confound us that we love God les then dogs do their maſters. Although a dog be chid away, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though beaten, although ſton'd, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be kept of, but comes more and more, he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:39021:66"/> followes him, he fawnes upon him: ſo muſt we ſerve and approach to God, by how much the more we are beaten and afflicted: for if theſe ſhould ceaſe, our chief occaſion of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting would ceaſe, nor could we give a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof, that we truly love him, and not ſerve him as mere hirelings.</p>

How wouldſt thou have me appear in thy preſence and ſpeak to thee, o humble majeſty, who diſdaineſt not the ſpeeches and prayers of men, yea deſireſt &amp; exhorteſt us to pray without intermiſſion! and ſuch is mans clowniſhnes that he loaths
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:39021:66"/> thee and thy converſation, and makes no other eſteem of thee, the lover of ſouls, then one would do of a deadly enemy. What is the firſt affront one puts upon his enemy, but to deny him ſpeech? and we, o ſweeteſt truth, will not converſe with thee, becauſe we love not truth: for what elſe would men do, if thou hated them, but what they now do when thou moſt tenderly loveſt them? as one enemy asks not advice of another, concerning his affaires and dangers, though he be held never ſo wiſe; ſo men in the midſt of perils and non-plus of redreſs, will not ſeek to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſd by thee, giving no eare to thy oracles and inſtructions, with which thou doſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us in time of prayer. Paſſionate men chuſe rather to periſh, then beg reliefe for their want of their mortal enemy, that they may not be forcd to ſpeak to him: and ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate malepertnes do they uſe towards thee, o affable ineffability; they are often preſſd with want, they are afflicted, they periſh, becauſe they demand not redreſs of thee, nor will ſpeak to thee: what greater ſigne of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, then that two living in the ſame houſe will not ſpeak to one another? man lies if he ſay he loves God and does not ſpeak to him, reſiding in him. Dumb freindſhip is not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhd from hatred.</p>
                  <p>God from all eternity, o ungrateful ſpirit, caſt his thoughts upon thee and thine: it is but good reaſon, that we in this ſhort tearm of life, conſider his divine beauty, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:39021:67"/> him, who would be ſo neer to us, that he united himſelf to our nature, and lodgeth ſo often in our breaſt: and that he might not depart from us, when he aſcended to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he invented that artificial maſter piece of his divine Sacrament, that he might ſtil remain with us. But our impudence and rech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſnes, found alſo out a way, that when we come to God by prayer, even then we leave him, &amp; become abſent, by letting our thoughts wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der abroad, and buſy themſelves with diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: we procure to be eſtrangd from him, that when he comes to us in his moſt amiable Sacrament, we fly to the vain thoughts of other affaires, and having entertaind ſuch a gueſt, we quit the room and appear no more.</p>
                  <p>But if, o man, thou carry not this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential reſpect to God, have at leaſt commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration upon thy ſelf; let thy own neceſsity perſwade thee to a love of prayer, if love of God force it not. Thou art nothing but ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, nothing but indigency; in prayer alone wilt thou both grow rich and wiſe: in prayer God will open thy eyes, to the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of wiſdome, and thy hands to receive reliefe for thy needines. Our prayers are as pleaſing to God, as it is acceptable to him to give, that which is moſt pleaſing of all the fruits of a beneficial nature. God did not create the world out of avarice, that he might have more then he had: but out of munificence, that he might have to whom to give: for this reaſon he created all things, that he might
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:39021:67"/> have both to whome and what to give. But becauſe we have made our ſelves unworthy of his liberality, the end for which the univerſe was created fayling, our prayers are grateful to God, becauſe they make ſatisfaction for our unworthines by ſin, by giving occaſion to him of doing for their ſakes, that for which he made all things, which is to be beneficent; in ſo much that it ſeems in a manner to be the ſame, to pray God and reſtore the univerſe. God cannot hold nor contain himſelf from being liberal, he is perpetually coveting to be beneficial; and therfore he exhorts us to pray without intermiſsion, becauſe he deſires to be giving without intermiſsion. Why do we fruſtrate his deſire and our own good? beg importunely; for this importune impudency in begging is grateful to him.</p>
                  <p>God many times differs to grant our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, although he be deſirous to give, either becauſe we ask after an unworthy manner, or not ſorrowful for our ſins or too confident of our own merits, or not with due reverence, or begging temporal things too earneſtly, and ſpiritual too remiſly: and for the moſt part we demand ſuch things, and after ſuch a faſhion, that the very granting our requeſt is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deſervedly its puniſhment. Were it a decent manner of asking any thing of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, if the murderer of his only Son, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in his hands, as yet imbrued with blood, the ſword wherewith he murderd him, ſhould beg of the father the Sons inheritance? what

Men frequently proceed thus; either not deteſting their faults, or remaining impenitent: they were our ſins that murderd Chriſt. We muſt go to pray pure and undefiled, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming upon our own merits, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our unworthines, dreſs our ſelves in the garments of our brother IESVS, according to the craft of Iacob, that ſo we may receive a bleſsing from God. Let us cloath our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves with the merits of IESVS which are ours; for he lent us them: not that they make us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally juſt and grateful to God, but becauſe they are the cauſe of our ſanctification. Being ſo apparreld, let us appear in prayer, uſing the mediation of his only-begotten, begging of God what he cannot deny us: then thou begſt not for thy ſelf, but for Chriſt and the favour is done to him. If thou make account thou giveſt to Chriſt what a beggar asketh in the name of Chriſt; the ſame is done by the heavenly father. If thou be moved when it is demanded for Chriſts ſake; how much more readily will God be moved to give an almes? is he leſs merciful then thou art miſerable?</p>
                  <p>Nevertheles many times thou art not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual with the father, although thou alledge the merits of his Son; becauſe the merits themſelves and ſufferings of Chriſt are not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual with thee. They ſay, if an Oratour would perſwade his auditory he muſt firſt of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:39021:68"/> all perſwade himſelf? Thou canſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of God, if he grant thee not thoſe graces which thou demandeſt by the Paſsion of his Son; ſince thou wilt not quit thy faults and daily defects for the ſame; how canſt thou expect to incline the will of the father to thee for the blood of his Son, if for the ſame thou wilt not yet quit thy own will. If thou ask after a les decent manner, how canſt thou hope to gain thy ſuit by a petition that's worthy of puniſhment? men expect to be petitiond, not only civilly but ſubmiſsively; and thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeſt to be eſſicacious with God being proud-harted, immodeſt, diſtracted? Learn of Chriſt in the garden how to pray; lying proſtrate on the ground, each joint as is were ſhivering and quaking, and all bathd in a bloody ſweat. If he had taken thee a part with him, to pray together to his heavenly father, the quires of Angels ſtanding amazd, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying that Angel who comforted IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS himſelf; wouldſt thou alſo ſleep then as the three Apoſtles did, or employ thy thoughts about the toyes and trifles of worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, beholding Chriſt in the interim in ſuch a plight for thy ſins, and the Angels ſo abſorpt in a reverential amazement. Thou that art about to intreat for thy own offences with teares, why wilt thou buſy thy mind with ſportive entertainments? how earneſtly doth a lawyer plead before a man, in a cauſe which concerns anothers life and death? be not thou wrechleſly ſlothful before God,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:39021:69"/> while thou pleadeſt for thy own crimes.</p>
                  <p>Conſider alſo what thou askeſt: what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent if his child ask a ſtone or Scorpion, will not be readier to give him an egg or a loafe of bread! why complaineſt thou of God, if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding temporal things, which are a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wherewith thou wilt intoxicate thy ſelf, and play the mad man againſt him, he grant thee ſpiritual? one muſt not give a ſword to a frantick perſon to hurt another, although he demand his own; how much les, if it be to hurt him that gives it? why doſt thou judge God ſo wicked or fooliſh, that asking what is not thy own, thou wouldſt have him give thee weapons, to hurt both thy ſelf and him? learn yet further of Chriſt how to pray: o moſt amiable and loving truth, let it not be as I will, but as thou: thy will be done in all; thou knows beſt what is expedient. Even ſpiritual guifts alſo are ſometimes differd, becauſe we ask them not with a due eſteem, neither are they ſought with like ardour and deſire that temporal things are. He asketh a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, who asketh great things but coldly and remisſly. God will have us ask ſeemly what beſeems him to give; and by differring the guift, he enkindles our deſire and diſpoſeth us more worthily. Men think to draw God to their frivolous ends, with any kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſooth him up with any piece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſtill him as we do a child with a rattle. Therfore it behoves God, not to be alwaies too facil, but give worthily guifts worthy of

                     </gap>ct them, expecting worthy ones. For when of his own accord he will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part his guifts unles intreated, he does it not for want of liberality, but out of a deſire of our profit, and a trial and exerciſe of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Therfore it is but good reaſon, that he expect complete prayers, and ſeeming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and not render his grace contemptible by giving it to him, who ſhewes he contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it while he begs it ſo tepidly; for we va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue not ſleightly what we compaſs with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and procraſtinated hopes have a more welcome iſſue.

Againſt all theſe, it hath but one only help and refuge, and that is prayer. How then can it be neglected or intermitted at any time, ſince the body, being better fencd againſt fewer enemies will have almoſt the whole day ſpent upon it, and that cuſtome never omitted.

We muſt never omit prayer, becauſe we never omit our corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral refection: and if at any time it be omitted, we are careful afterward to make amends. If one for three or fower daies together, ſhould refrain from ſleep, out of a mere covetouſnes of labouring, in a ſhort time he would goe mad: five houres or more are neceſſary each day for our corporal reſt: the repoſe of our ſoul is prayer: very many, becauſe quitting their good purpoſes, they betake themſelves ſo late to it, become giddy-braind, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Our prayer which is the food and repoſe of our ſoul, muſt be quiet and free from diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance: for we take our bodily ſuſtenance, though corruptible, and ſhortly to be together with our ſelves the food of wormes, ſitting and with quietnes. The benefit of prayer is not ſtinted to that hour or time we are at it, but hath influence upon the whole day. A little leaven ſeaſons the whole batch, and a little prayer will ſeaſon the whole day. Prayer is not only beneficial, for that reſpit of time wherin we pray, becauſe we ſpend it well and to our own advantage; but much more in regard of the whole day, that we looſe it not wholly.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:39021:71"/> be ſeconded at leaſt with one houres pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers After a due and fervent prayer, one is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhd with holy illuſtrations, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlace themſelves ever and anon amidſt our ſucceeding employments. After a great noiſe is paſt, there remaines a ringing and buzzing in our eares, and the daies actions become fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ſubject of our dreames: ſo from the repoſe of prayer, certain images of what paſt in it, diffuſe themſelves through our daily affaires, and holy inſpirations do frequently recur: he that looks ſtedfaſtly upon the ſun, what ſoever he beholds afterwards, ſeems to carry a reſemblance thereof. Although one know compleatly what appertaines to his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, prayer conduceth much to ground him more ſolidly in it. Truths themſelves gotten by prudence, experience, learning and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do penetrate more profoundly when in prayer they come from above: corne fields proſper better when they are waterd from heaven, then by the inlet of a brook or fountain: the higher a ſtone fals the more impetuous is its motion, and makes a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per dint in the ground. The ſame truth coming from heaven, ſtrikes the hart with a deeper impreſſion and excites more vigorouſly to fervour and devotion. They are our wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed propenſions, that miſlead us from the paths of vertue, and this obſtacle is removed by the benefit of prayer, which by devotion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets inclinations to good, and is a kind of fuel which feeds the ardour of doing well, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:39021:72"/> the fuel of ſin. But why do I inſiſt ſo much upon the advantages of prayer? its enough for me, o divine truth, that thou ſheweſt thy ſelf moſt affable in it, &amp; moſt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful towards me: there thou diſcoverſt thy ſelf, there I embrace thee; and repoſe as in thy armes in this tumult of affaires. Thou ſheweſt thy ſelf in it o clear-ſhining truth, to my endarkned ſpirit as in thy throne, that it may harbour no guile nor deceit.</p>
                  <p>Our prayer muſt alſo be prolix, while health and age permits, that ſo we may ſupply for the time of ſicknes when we cannot, and muſt alwaies think we have prayd but little. That moſt elevated man and great zealot of God F. Didacus Martinius, made every day with great diligence and ſtrict account 4. thouſand acts of love to God; and added a part ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſum, purpoſely to make recompenſe for the time of his laſt ſicknes, if perchance then he ſhould not be able, as he deſird, to attend to God: he moreover ſpent every day ten houres with great recollection in converſing with him by fervent prayer. That devout Father Michael Soſa when old age and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenes of pain in his long and laſt ſicknes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his exerciſe of prayer, exhorted his Brethren and complaind of himſelf ſaying: make, make amends, o Brethren, for all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſnes in the exerciſe of prayer, while age and ſtrength enables you, providing thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the future injuries of nature, when ye would pray, and neither age nor ſicknes will
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:39021:72"/> permit it: I am ſorry now that I cannot pray when I would; I am ſorry I did not when I could. So did he accuſe himſelf, whoſe mind was ſo abſorpt in God, that he would walk up and down like one in an extaſy: when he was about to waſh his hands, forgetting to turn the cock of the lavatory, he often rubd them, as if the water had fallen upon them, &amp; afterwards wipt them with the towel as if they had bin waſhd. Somtimes being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in ſpirit, he ſufferd a rapture for 8. hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res together, and being come to himſelf he thought it no more then a little quarter. O confuſion, and our benumdnes! we that ſtand in far greater need of praying, are quickly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and think that ſhort reſpit of time, which we beſtow upon God, or rather purchaſe to our ſelves, very long; but when it is loſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with men, it ſeemes but ſhort: and if we perſiſt as long in prayer as worldlings ſit at a banquet, we think we have done more then enough.</p>

Grant, o eternal truth, that I may clearly diſcover ſomething that I have in Chriſt and the immenſe riches that are reſervd for me in my IESVS. We know not, we know not, o mortals, what treaſures we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs in Chriſt! The brethren of Ioſeph were afflicted with famine, becauſe they were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that he raignd in Aegypt: why are we afflicted? our brother raignes in heaven. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce all ye ſinners and beggars, ye that are in calamity and diſtreſs, becauſe that brother of yours, that loves you more tenderly then does all the world beſides, who of all others ſticks cloſeſt to you, is higheſt in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, is moſt wealthy, is God, and for your ſakes hath bin afflicted. I congratulate, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate with ſinners, becauſe Chriſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath moſt fully ſatisfyed the divine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, fruſtrating all its hope of making a prey of you, and this without any double deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea in all rigour of equity. Chriſt is the comfort of divine mercy, and the treaſure of Gods clemency. I congratulate with the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I congratulate with the miſerable, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate with the diſtreſſed; becauſe it is your moſt loving brother, who hath the dividing of the divine treaſures as he thinks good, who gives charters of beatitude, and grants of true joy. God hath placd for maſter of his family not a forraigner, not an Angel, but your very own brother.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt is our moſt faithfull friend: for when
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:39021:73"/> we, as being naked and miſerable, were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unworthy to appeare before the king; he that we might come into the preſence of God our ſoveraign, not only not unworthily but after a moſt honorable manner, and ſo obtaine mercy at his hands, he I ſay, clad us with a moſt rich purple died in his own preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood, to wit, divine grace merited for us by his Paſſion, and remaining inherent in us. He ſatiates our hungar with his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he quencheth our thirſt with his ſacred blood, he enricheth our penury with the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple treaſure of his inexhauſtible merits. If thou wilt know how much Chriſts merits are thine, &amp; how thou maiſt employ them to gaine grace, &amp; offer them to God to obtaine mercy, hence gather it; to wit, becauſe he reput'd thy ſins his. It was ſaid in the perſon of Chriſt; the words of my offences. Yet we muſt not think his merits ſo to be ours, as that it is not needful to have any of our own, but may be ſaved by ſitting ſtil &amp; doing nothing: for Ieſus died not that we might be negligent but fervent and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the divine ſervice. Even as the ſoul of Chriſt could not ſuffer damnation for thy ſins unles he committed ſome himſelf, which was impoſſible; ſo neither ſhalt thou be ſaved by the merits of Chriſt, unles thou do good works and have grace inherent in thee, which nevertheles is alſo from Chriſt. He gave us then his merits, that we might uſe them as our own, to appeaſe Gods wrath and indignation, no otherwiſe then he took upon him our ſins
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:39021:74"/> as his own to make ſatisfaction; he grieved he deplored them, he ſatisfyd for them as if they had been his own delinquencies. He gave us not his meer naked works but cloathd in their robes of dignity, that is, as performd by a divine perſon: inſomuch that as he took upon him our ſins, as committed by moſt vile and abject creatures his ſervants; ſo we ſhould partake of his merits, as treaſurd up by the Son of God equal to his heavenly father.</p>
                  <p>Let us imitate Chriſt in as much as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to himſelf our faults, that we may learn how to uſe his merits and appropriate them to our ſelves. Deem o ſinner, Chriſts merits thine, and upon that account make thy demands with great confidence: for this is to ask in the name of Chriſt. His merits given to us are far more available to this, then if we had done the ſame our ſelves &amp; had been cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed for the glory of God: for in that caſe they would not be the works of God but man a ſinner. Lo then how much thou art obligd to Chriſt, who took upon him thy ſins, and gave thee his merits; who quitted thee of ſo great evil, and beſtowd upon thee ſo great good. Theſe two ſcores upon which he demands this ſatisfaction of thee, are infinitly obligatory; to wit, that as he ſatisfyd for thy ſins as if he had committed them; ſo thou muſt not offer the merits of Chriſts otherwiſe to God and procure grace by them, then as if they were thy own.</p>
                  <p>O moſt ſweet IESV, that I could but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:39021:74"/> what benefit and advantages have &amp; do accrue to us ſo wretched from thee! we were monſters of horrour; and now by thy meanes we are become a ſpectacle grateful to God: we were in the very mud and bottom of hel; and now we are in the boſome, I wil not ſay of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham the father of nations, but of God thy father: we were in the throat of the infernal dragon; now we are in the hart of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: we were an object unworthy of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eyes; now we are worthy of his embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: we were ſlaves comdemnd to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of hel; now by thee we ſhal be crownd kings of heaven. Who can conceive whither we had precipitated our ſelves, and to what thou haſt exalted us? our miſery ought to have been throughly contented, if thou hadſt only freed us out of hel; but not thy mercy, unles thou hadſt alſo elevated us above the heavens and ſo many Angels: thou hadſt done too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, when we were involud in an irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſery, and ſo deſperately, that all redreſs ſeemd wholy impoſſible, if thou hadſt only obtaynd of thy father a ſurceaſe of his anger; but thou gotteſt us alſo our pardon: thou hadſt done too much in getting our pardon; but thou moreover ga inedſt us his good will, his love and his favour: thou hadſt done too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much and a thing deſerving admiration, if thou hadſt only won his good will; but thou obtainedſt for us alſo guifts and graces: thou hadſt done too much, and what might worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make us amazd if thou hadſt obtaind for us
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:39021:75"/> but the leaſt guift at Gods hand; but thou haſt gotten us his kingdom and thy own inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. thou hadſt done too much, if thou hadſt effected this but once; but thou haſt effected that it ſhould be given us innumerable times, if we faulterd ſo often, ſuppoſing we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to thee by true pennance: laſtly thou obtainedſt for us whatſoever God poſſeſſeth, &amp; vouchſafedſt to admit us, as loathſome &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable as we wer, to ſhare with thee in thy patrimony. Behold, o man, from whence Chriſt hath deliverd thee, and where he hath inſtalld thee! if thou unwittingly and at hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazard hadſt freed another not from death, but ſome caſual diſtreſs, what thanks and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude wouldſt thou expect from him? ſavage beaſts are grateful even for ſome benefits: a fierce lion, for one thorn pulld out of his foot, was mindful of the good turn after a long time and requited it: and why make we the immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe benefits conferrd on us by Chriſt, of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour rank to thoſe of wild beaſts, and rather ſtand not amazd and at a nonplus through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of gratitude? but perchance Chriſt was obligd to do for us what he did, or did it with caſe and with out expenſe? nay we were his enemies; and the buſines was moſt difficult and deſperate; and the atchieving it coſt him no leſs then the price of his blood and pretious life.</p>
                  <p>O Immenſe charity of God, what haſt thou done for hatefulman! when we were in an impoſſibility of ſalvation, and knew not
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:39021:75"/> which way to turne our ſelves, thou o moſt merciful God, foundeſt out a remedy, a devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, a ſtratagem of ſtupendious mercy: and when the compaſſing of it was out of our reach, thou thy ſelf wouldſt execute the deſign. But what kind of remedy was it? what captive durſt wiſh, much leſs ask of his king, that to gain his freedom he would become priſoner? Thou, o my IESVS, wert content for our ſakes to do more, then we durſt either hope or wiſh. Thou being the king of glory, wert bound for us hand and foot; and treated as one that pleads guilty, yea condemnd and executed for us thy enemies, that ſtood im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachd of high treaſon. It were an act worth admiration, if an Emperour ſhould daigne to viſit a peaſant caſt into priſon for his miſde meanours; and how much more if his own betraier? what if he ſhould quit his throne for him, and in a diſguiſd habit remain pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, while the malefactour made an eſcape? Thou didſt this, o moſt loving IESVS. His praiſe is never ſufficiently renownd, who made himſelf captive to redeem his friend; nor that ſervant, who to reſcue his king, expoſd himſelf both to his enemies &amp; death; nor that parent who loſt one of his own eyes, to ſave one of his ſons, who otherwiſe had loſt both. But what wonder if a friend for a friend, a ſervant for a king, a parent for his child did ſuch a feat? how much more did my IESVS for me not a friend but an enemy, not his king but a baſe ſlave of the divel, not
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:39021:76"/> his child, but a child of perdition. If he had pardond me my treſpaſs, it had been enough; but he relinquiſhd his throne, he loſt his life, and over and above enthrond me in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. If he had only canceld the diſgrace and infamy of my ſin, he had ſhewd a rare cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, though the puniſhment due for it had ſtood good; but he hath pardond the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and repleniſhd me both with joy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Are theſe things perchance falſe, or is fayth infallible? if they be truth it ſelf, how chances it, that while we relate them with our mouth, we are not affected towards the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt with our hart, who gave us his hart, and inclind and ſtil inclines the hart of God towards us? O how dear ought IESVS to be to us, by whom we are ſo dear to God? how much beloved by us, for whom we are ſo much beloved by God!</p>
                  <p>Conſider what great good thou enjoyeſt in Chriſt: infallibly God would not endure us and our impudency, if Chriſt were not our mediatour: he beautifies our deformity and renders us comely in the eyes of God: he cloathd our nakednes with grace and attir'd us in his own robes, when we were ſo miſerably tatterd, that we could not appeare in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God; and enricht us with his merits that we may appeare. How gratefuly did he take it at S. Martins hands, that he gave him but the one half of his cloak. IESVS glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and made as it were a flouriſh before the Angels with that torne rag: and we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:39021:76"/> to him, who clad us in purple and a divine garment, when we were naked, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and infected with leproſy: not that he might only cloak the ſoare, but throughly cure the loathſome diſeaſe; and being waſhd, like Naaman as it were in a Iordan, make us truly ſound and beautiful: neither do we prize the garment, and grace, and his merits for whoſe ſake his Father tolerates us, takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of us, and, which is the chiefe, makes us the object of his love. O ungrateful mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals! how comes it to paſs, that your harts are not forc'd after Chriſt who is our treaſure our riches, and our beauty? without him we are deformed and unſightly to the eyes of God, by him comely and conſpicuous.</p>
                  <p>God ſtands proportionably in order to mankind, and Chriſt its redeemer, as doth our eye to its object, which is colour &amp; light. Without light all colours are inviſible, they are void of all beauty; it by only illuminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them beautifies them: ſo Chriſt who was a light to the revelation of nations, makes God look regardingly upon us men, now viſible and ſightly to his eyes, who were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before in darknes and the ſhadow of death. Light is the firſt and chief in the claſs of viſible things, very agreable to good eyes; by it all other things are ſeen and only ſeen ſo far forth as they partake of it: for only with light, or in light or by light, colours are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable: light reſides in the colour, with our eye, and in the ſpace intermediate betwixt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:39021:77"/> both. So Chriſt is that which is the firſt and moſt viſible in the divine eyes; moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and acceptable to thoſe of his Father; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men only are ſo, for as much as they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of him: by him, and with him, and in him they are conſpicuous; tis he that diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them and makes them regardable before God. All the luſtre and grace of colours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in light, and by its meanes hath its being; and all the glory, honour, and grace of men is by Chriſt, it is all his bleſſing and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Mark how regardles the choiſeſt and lovelyeſt rarities are by night, they are as if they were a ſleep or rather not at all: ſo ſoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits and ſubtle wits without Chriſt lie ſhrowded in darknes, and are no more regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable then a nothing. Why then doſt thou glory in any thing beſides him? without light fair and foul is all one, and both of them in a ſorry condition: without grace by Chriſt a ſharp and piercing wit and a dul and doltiſh one is much the ſame, and all other endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature, art, and induſtry are no more then if they were not at all. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens alſo and the ſun are only beneficial by their light, by which they effect all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions; ſo God by Chriſt alone communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates all the bleſſings he imparts to man. Of all our ſublunary ſimple qualities the heavens admit none beſides light; ſo neither ſhall any man aſcend to heaven, but he whom the light of Chriſt irradiates; neither ſhal any prayer be heard with acceptance which petitions not
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:39021:77"/> by his ſacred name.</p>
                  <p>O IESVS the light of men, the true light which illuminates every man coming into this world, illuminate me, that thy Father may behold me, who if he ſee in me any thing of thine cannot reject me; if he hear thy name in my mouth cannot but harken to me. O the force of the grace of our only-begotten Chriſt, which begets ſo many children ſo grateful to God! where Chriſt is or his name is heard, thither mercy flies immediately, there mercy is certainly to be found. O how efficaciouſly ſounds the voice of Chriſt, by which we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuage his Fathers anger, and preſs him to our relief! How can ſuch obſequiouſnes of his only Son moſt obedient, moſt holy, moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious, moſt loving, but move moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ſuch a parent, eſpecially ſince he ſees himſelf beloved by him alone according to the fulnes of his deſert, amidſt ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerating affronts of men? The name of a child, preſcinding from all reſpects of duty, is grateful even to the moſt unnatural and miſerly; what then will it be to a moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent God, eſpecially if we add ſo many ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces exhibited even to his unthankful enemies. He that conſiders Chriſts dutifulnes towards his Father, wil adjudge all rewards more then due to him. His father loſt the world by the ſin of man; but ſuch was the officiouſnes of his Son that he regaind it, &amp; reſtord it to him; &amp; was this a ſmal piece of ſervice? All mankind and innumerable Angels became rebellious &amp;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:39021:78"/> refractory to his Father; the Son took upon him to quel their ſtubborneſs and teach them obedience, and this at the expenſe even of his own life. All mortals fel into a high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Father; the Son by honouring him would make amends for all: he finally reſtord him ſo many ſervants, he gave him ſo many worſhippers, ſo many lovers, ſo many prayſers, he peopled heaven that was void of inhabitants: and were theſe but ſleight ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? But with what affection, what diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, what love, what ſeemlines performd he this? it was altogether infinite, and ſuch, that neither power nor knowledge remaines to the Father, whereby to exceed in rewards the merits of his Son.</p>
                  <p>If God then be of ſuch a munificent nature, that of his own accord he is beneficial to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: if ſo juſt, that he rewards them beyond their merits, and goes out of himſelf that he may be bountiful to all, expecting no juſt title which exacts his beneficence: wil he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed partially with his Son alone, and not have regard to the preſcript of their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which as yet the divine liberality in all its extent fals ſhort? what will he do when he ſees that he cannot outſtrip the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Son; but that all the rewards he gave him and all men for his ſake, are infinitly below his ſervices? will he that was profuſe to ſinners, be injuſtly pinching to his own Son? will he refuſe to give what he demands or we ask for his ſake, ſuppoſing he cannot
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:39021:78"/> reward him too much, nor hath hitherto done it ſufficiently? if God be munificent beyond all expectation, to wit, when men judge puniſhment more due then favour; wil he be niggardly and ſparing when they think him bound, not only to do it by way of friendſhip, but alſo in a manner claymd as a due debt? if God hath bin bountiful to ſome maſters for a ſilly ſervants ſake, becauſe he did his duty: what will he be to his beloved Son, in whoſe ſole ſervice he took more complacence then in all the world beſides? if he eſteem men ſo highly, that he uſd thoſe expreſſions, for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob my ſervants ſake and Iſrael my choſen; and elſewhere, for David my ſervant &amp;c. and this when he was in a veine of indulgence; wil he miſprize his beloved Son moſt dutyful to him, and be harſh and unmerciful to him, in whom he ſo gratifid us? o men, let us make our demands ſecurely, nay moſt ſecurely by Chriſt; let us approach with confidence to the throne of his grace; becauſe how great guifts ſoever we demand, God wil remaine indebted for greater; and becauſe he excuſeth not himſelf nor diſclaimes the debt, he will never remaine ungrateful or unjuſt, but will give what we ask, ſince he neither hath nor can give all that his Son meriteth. Behold, behold, I now ſee more clearly then the ſun, that it is wholly impoſſible for him to deny whatſoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:39021:79"/> do it ſo coldly and fooliſhly, that it is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a mock-petition. But he that makes it truly and really in the name of Chriſt, not only intreats, but as it were conjures and exacts.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt is the object and delight of all the divine ſenſes: God ſees nothing that's ſeemly, but by Chriſt: he hears nothing that's harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, but by Chriſt: nothing is fragrant &amp; ſweet to him, but the good odour of Chriſt: he annoints &amp; heales nothing with his mercy but by the oyle of the name of Chriſt: noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laſtly relliſheth ſavourly to his pallat, but what is ſeaſond and ſweetned with the paſſion and gal of Chriſt. Whatſoever he feels all is grateful by Chriſt, ſo regarding us in him: becauſe we reſemble Chriſt, we are pleaſing to him: as one that looks through a green glaſs, all that he ſees is green and agreable to his ſight, though before diſagreeing; that colour which of all others is moſt pleaſing to the eye, tempering the incongruity of the object. O how far would God be from tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating our loath ſomnes and naſtines if it were not for his ſake! o how often would he be out of patience with us, even after we are once put in the ſtate of grace, which we deſervd to forfeit for our ingratitude and non-compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and many other venial ſins, if he did not think upon him who ſuſtaines us and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies for our defects. He alone is a lenitive to his Father to make him reliſh les noy ſomely, our impudence and unthankfulnes. The world

Chriſt interpoſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf betwixt us and his Father, who behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in him, our deformity doth les offend him; as he that beholds a dead dog but in a looking glaſs, feels not the ſtench it ſends forth: hurtful objects when they are ſeen through a glaſs are not offenſive to the eyes: It fares with God as it did with that Emperour who having a very faire emerald, which like a mirrour reflected objects, he beheld in it all ſpectacles of horrour as combats of duelliſts, ſlaughters, and whatſoever cauſd averſion; to the end that the pleaſingnes of the ſtone might abate and ſweeten the diſtaſtfulnes of the fact: ſo our miſdemeanours do les exaſperate God, when he beholds them repreſented in Chriſt. Chriſt is a gem and moſt pretious emerald: nothing is more pleaſing to the eye then that ſtone, whoſe only ſight is ſaid to exhilarate it; and it ſhuts not up this grateful colour within its own incloſure, but imparts it to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring aire, void otherwiſe of all colour. So Chriſt cauſeth joy to God, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates his merits to us, who have none of our own, to the end that being endowd with his grace and the verdure of hope, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide that by him we ſhall be acceptable to God. All our good and graces are but only the exuberancies &amp; as it were the ſuperfluities and offals of the merits of Chriſt:</p>

                     </gap>ands in need of other helps and induſtries for our redreſs! Chriſt the incarnate truth was a wonderful invention to ſatisfy the divine juſtice; but becauſe this inſtrument of mercy was to be our Iudge, Gods love towards Chriſt provided another organ of pure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, his moſt ſacred Mother; for which among other immenſe benefits of the divine goodnes we ought to be thankful. What had become of us if Mary the mother of mercy had not been? by whoſe prayers, though our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity and ſhameleſnes, which is alwaies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting God, deſerve a continual ſcourge, yet his revenging hand is ſuſpended, and the ſcourge changd into a guift. Chriſts reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards his Mother is more prevalent then our irreverence towards him: If he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd his life for his enemies, and thoſe who by crucifying him deprivd him of life; what wil he not do for his deareſt Mother, of whom he received life? if God did ſo great and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable things of his own accord and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:39021:80"/> for creatures to whom he gave a being; what will he do for her of whom he took his ſubſtance and Humanity; ſhe eſpecially me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diating and urging him by her interceſſions &amp; as it were commanding him by the right and prerogative of a Mother? the intreaties of a Mother are as good as a command to toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly children: and what child more towardly then Chriſt? or what Mother better then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? what greater obligation imaginable, then that of the beſt of children to the beſt of mothers? the obligation of CHRIST is not like that of other children to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but like that of creatures to their God: It is not only ſuch a one as interceeds betwixt the begetter and the begotten (although this alſo is greater in Chriſt, ſince it is not divided betwixt two, like as other children owe their being both to father and mother: for he took humane nature of his Mother alone, he having according to it no father, and therfore he owes ſolely to her his being a man) but it is alſo a moral obligation.</p>
                  <p>Children owe duty and reſpect to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, although they intend not this child in particular but any other; yea although they beget him againſt their will, and would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have begotten none, nevertheles this tie of nature is ſo ſacred, that even Barbarians &amp; hethens were of opinion, that parents were to be worſhipped as ſecond Gods, &amp; that the debt which was owing them could never be diſchargd. O IESVS, whoſe doctrine tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:39021:81"/> the ſubtileſt capacity of Philoſophers; whoſe example ſurpaſſd all humane opinion; if Ethnicks deliverd ſuch precepts about ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring parents, what wilt thou, o Son of God, do in honouring thine? that was the reſpect which Gentils afforded; how much more perfect will thine be, o IESVS? thou who didſt build upon the vertues of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and added to their precepts; thou who to the lawes of love ſuperadded that of loving our enemies, &amp; in the command of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity declard even concupiſcence to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: ſo alſo in the precept of reverencing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents thou didſt excel in reverence towards thy mother; wherin beſides the debt due by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thou oweſt another of free election. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parents have nothing of choiſe in the child they beget, but with thy moſt holy Mother it fared much otherwiſe: ſhe not only bore thee but would only bear thee alone and no other but thee. Her good will was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſird by God the father and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: therfore becauſe thou art endebted to her for this elective will, thou repayſt it by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her nothing which ſhe wils. Thou doſt acknowledg a ſtricter obligation towards her then other children have to theirs; one like to that which creatures have towards their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. This is the great debt of creation, that God did not only create us, but ſelected us in particular and producd us rather then others, whom he left in that heap of things only poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and their own nothing.</p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:39021:81"/>
                  <p> O ſtupendious excellency of Mary, ſeing God is in like manner obligd to her that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are to him which is infinite! and then, as there is an immenſe diſtance betwixt being and not being, ſo the obligation of him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives being and life, infinitly ſurpaſſeth all other obligations ariſing from other common benefits which preſuppoſe being and life. If then, o God worthy of all love thou art moſt liberal towards thoſe that are moſt deeply endebted to thee, and moſt indulgent to thoſe that offend thee; how canſt thou be griping or hard harted to thy own Mother, to whom alone thou art endebted, and in ſuch a manner endebted for the riches of thy mercy and goodnes. How canſt thou deny any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour where thou acknowledges ſo great a debt? thou doſt deſervedly impart all by her who imparted life to thee: for as children can, by no goods whatſoever make recompenſe to their parents for the benefit of life; becauſe it is the foundation of all other benefits; and all the actions &amp; natural endowments of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are properly belonging to parents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they gave them their firſt being: in like manner thou wilt deny nothing to her who gave thee humane nature; inſomuch that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all by thy Mother, thou ſeemſt to give all to thy Mother; and moreover putſt us upon a neceſſity of honouring her, ſince thou wilt have us to obtain what we obtain by her: and becauſe thou hadſt of her thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural being, that is, humane nature; ſo wilt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:39021:82"/> thou alſo, that we have from her a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral being, that is grace: that ſo by making us the children of Mary ſupernaturally, thou mayſt ſatisfy for thy humane filiation by her naturally.</p>
                  <p>True it is that all things are from God, &amp; this very thing that he is a debter to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is one of his benefits: but this imports not much towards our right underſtanding how much he is ready to do for the moſt B. Virgin; for this is the cuſtome and faſhion of God, to regard his own favours no otherwiſe then if he had no hand in our merits, though they proceed from his grace; but is as boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in rewarding them, as if they were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our own: he will give as ful a recompenſe for our good works as if theſe good works were not his guifts, nor he aſſiſted us with his grace, but we performd our ſervices by our own ſtrength, and carried of our ſelves that proportion to glory; after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will he correſpond with the duties of his Mother as if he had contributed nothing to them; but will proceed as if he had receivd eſſence, nature, and life from her indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of any benefit and divine grace, by which ſhe was prevented and preelected to that ſtupendious work of the divine Conception.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt acknowledg and eſteem himſelf thus obligd, will he perchance infringe the precept of honouring parents, or rather ſeek to fulfil it with preſſd &amp; heapt meaſure? if the obligation wherewith other children are tied
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:39021:82"/> to their parents be ſo great that Philoſophers judgd it indiſſoluble; ſince Chriſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth a greater then any other, can he poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly faile in gratitude? if God recompenſe with glory the minute ſervices of men even beyond their deſert, he will not be wanting in any kind to diſcharge and ſatisfy this debt to his Mother which exceeds all rewards and recompenſe. Who can doubt but that Chriſts gratitude towards his Mother ſurpaſſeth the love and gratitude of all other men? If then ethnicks were of opinion, that children, how obſequious ſoever, cannot be gratefull enough to their parents; can we imagine that Chriſt will let ſlip any occaſion of gratitude to her? in a word he was ſo grateful towards his deareſt parent, that not content with that reverence which he exhibited to her the while he lived in the exerciſe of infinite theandricall acts with which he honoured her, in being ſubject to her; he would have all us to honour her alſo, and help him as it were to do the ſame. For that end he would have all us become her children, that for him we might love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her as our Mother. For as there was an obligation due to her as Mother, he would alſo have ſuch ſatisfaction and gratitude as is proper to children. Which filiation he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated on the altar of the Croſs, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathd all his to her in the perſon of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Diſciple, ſaying, behold thy Son. He did it, to wit, when he was at the very point of death, as if he had only deſird life that he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:39021:83"/> might be dutiful to his Mother: but being not expedient that he ſhould avoid it, he left a deputy of his filial care and obedience in Saint John, and of obſervance in the reſt of the faithful: that by this meanes he might both redeem us by dying, and alſo be grateful to her, by leaving ſo many to ſupply for him in exhibiting reſpect, as if he confeſsd himſelf not to have fully accompliſhd his deſire in that behalf. There at the foot of the croſs Mary took us for her children, there ſhe brought us forth, not of her womb but her hart, which is a more pretious member, and its filiation more efficacious. For each child of the womb is not alwaies beloved but the child of ones hart cannot but be ſo. Ther did ſhe bear us together with Chriſt amidſt thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and pangs which ſhe felt, not in her carnal labour or child bed. She took us very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely for her children at ſuch a time when her bowels were wholly repleniſhed with an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate compaſsion towards her Son, that ſhe might transfer it upon us, and by it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble her mercy: as if IESVS had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to his Mother what he ſaid to the woemen; Weep not over me but over your children. And therfore hanging on the croſs ful of anguiſh and torment, remitting as it were to others all compaſsion due to him, he ſaid to his weeping Mother; Mother behold thy Son: behold each faithful Chriſtian &amp; my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is thy child: do not ſo much compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and weep over me as over theſe thy
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:39021:83"/> children, poor wretches and miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whom I recommend to thy motherly tuition. Chriſt knew that the miſery of ſin was a greater object of mercy then any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral pain whatſoever: for his ſoul did more feelingly reſent our offences, then his body did its own torments. Therfore he would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve his Mother transfer her compaſsion and mercy to the defects, faultines, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our ſoul, that ſhe might chiefly aſsiſt us in them. And becauſe Chriſt by his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings deſervd well of the divine juſtice for his ſuperabundant ſatisfaction, therfore was he worthy of that attribute of being judge of all men, according to the prediction of David; give, o God, thy judgment to the king &amp; thy juſtice to the kings Son: the Mother of Chriſt by compaſsionating and commiſerating him, deſervd well the attribute conferrd upon her of compaſsion, &amp; commiſeration that we alſo may ſay; thou haſt given, o God, thy mercy to the queen, and thy pious affection to the kings Mother: therfore no grace nor mercy is derivd to us but by Mary. From hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, o moſt pious Mother, I take thee for mine; &amp; will have this to be the firſt pledge of thy piety, that thou imitate thy firſt begotten Son, who as he not only gave thee to Iohn, but Iohn alſo to thee; ſo thou give me to God, ſince thou alſo gave God to us.</p>
                  <p>Therfore ſince our miſery finds no redreſs but in Gods mercy, and the diſpoſal of it is Mary's power to whom her Son denies noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:39021:84"/> and ſhe ful of commiſeration; why are we ſo ſlow and backeward in the diſcharge of our duty and devotion towards her? we muſt for 4. reaſons be very officious in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Virgin Mother. The firſt is the neceſsity and advantage of her interceſsion; for without her intercourſe and ſollicitation no guifts diſcend from heaven: grace depends far more upon Mary then the ſhowers of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven did on Elias. The ſecond is the will of Chriſt; whoſe deſire is that we honour his Mother; and in honoring her, we do him a piece of grateful ſervice. For he turnes over to her all the debts we owe him, and ſhe is our creditrice, who muſt ſee them cancelld. If what we do to the poor be ſo acceptable to him, that he takes it as done to himſelf, and makes them his ſubſtitutes in this behalf; how much more gratefully will he take what is done to his Mother, whoſe debter he acknowledgeth himſelf, to whome all are endebted.</p>
                  <p>The third cauſe is the excellency of the moſt H. Virgin; to whoſe worſhip though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the tie of neceſſity, nor the explicite will of her ſon IESVS did move us; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the ſole title of her rare prerogatives and perfections ought to endeare us extremely to her. She is the glory of all pure creatures, and eſpecially of mankind; the next in dignity to God himſelf; to whom he granted this priviledg which he alone by reaſon of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of his nature enjoies, to be together a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:39021:84"/> Mother and a Virgin, and Mother of God. God is both a father and a Virgin; Mary is alſo a Mother &amp; a Virgin. And like as Chriſt according to his divinity was moſt chaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in the ſplendours of Saints by a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin father without a Mother, ſo according to his humanity, he was moſt chaſtly begotten in the ſplendours of ſanctity refulgent above all Saincts, of a Virgin Mother without a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. O double miracle! both that a Virgin brings forth, and that ſhe brings forth God! and indeed what ſhould a Virgin bring forth but God? grace and nature are two ſiſters; the ſame artificer gave them both a being: and therfore their proceeding in their different functions is much a like. Even as God after he had created all things made an abridgment of them all in Adam and Eve; and all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of life and nature are more eminently in man then in the natures themſelves, heavens, plants, and living creatures; inſomuch that one man is more valuable then the whole world beſides, and is as it were a little world by himſelf, and all things do him homage, and were made for his uſe: ſo in like manner becauſe Gods workmanſhip is no les exactly curious in matters of grace, he alſo compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated in the ſecond Adam and Eve, the whole extent of grace, that ever hath or ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to men and Angels. And Mary alone containes all kind of bleſſings, and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural guifts and degrees of grace in a more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular manner then all the Hierarchies of B.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:39021:85"/> Spirits and quires of Saints: in ſuch ſort that ſhe alone doth equalize all their ſanctity and perfection. Not piety only but reaſon alſo atteſteth this aſſertion; and now it is manifeſt enough by the revelation made to that B. Man and martir of Chriſt F. Martin Gutierez whom S. Tereſa beheld in heaven adornd with the enſignes of martirdome, he dying in priſon under the heretiques, wearied out with their fetters and il uſage. The Virgin her ſelf gave many thanks to this her ſervant for defending her ſanctity in theſe eminent tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. The very Seraphins themſelves, and all the other ranks both of Angels and Saints doe homage to her and reverence her as queen of all: no otherwiſe then the brute beaſts in paradiſe to Adam, while he ſtood as yet in the integrity of his nature. Man was created in a degree much ſuperiour to other creatures; Mary was exalted above the Cherubins, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifid more then all theſe glorious intelligences, ſurmounting them as far as Adam did the common creatures. She alone ſeems to be twice as great with God, and much deeper in his favour then the whole world beſides; towards which though the Son of God ſhewd a wonderful dignation in deſcending from heaven for its redemption; yet it could not receive the H. Ghoſt unles heaven firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivd him again: but the Virgin Mother at the ſelf ſame time entertaind both him and the H. Ghoſt in his ſuperventions.</p>
                  <p>Therfore the prayers of Mary are effectual
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:39021:85"/> with Chriſt for two reſpects; both for obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance due to a Mother and for the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matenes of her merits and ſanctity: for ſhe is heard both for reſpect and reverence oweing to him, and worth and dignity due to her ſelf: for the reverence of her maternity, for the worth of her vertue and ſanctity: and we alſo are heard for her ſake: whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is not only proficuous but alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Therfore let us fly to Mary in all our diſtreſſes, as the child doth to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who is beaten by a ſtranger: ſhe knowes how to ſupport and uphold the tottering world with her prayers, nor think that thou laieſt a heavy burden upon her.</p>
                  <p>The fourth cauſe may be an aſſinity and kind of alliance contracted with the moſt B. Virgin, not only ſpiritualy and after a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal manner, but even real and according to the body and nature. For no body is nigher in kindred to another then the ſacred Virgin is to thee. He that receives Chriſts body in the Euchariſt, becomes by a real kind of union one fleſh with him: inſomuch that there is no other union among men ſtraiter then this, not even betwixt man and wife: wherfore thou muſt alſo eſteem thy ſelf akin to the Mother of Chriſt, and perſwade thy ſelf, that thou ſhareſt in the ſame fleſh with her. There in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceeds alſo a greater phyſical and real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction betwixt God and thee, then there is betwixt thee and thy father: how great then will that be which thou contracteſt with
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:39021:86"/> the Mother of God? what created and real union can be imagind greater then that which paſſeth betwixt the divine word and his moſt ſacred Humanity, derived from the very bowels of the moſt H. Virgin? and what link of conſanguinity can be ſtraiter then that betwixt Chriſt and his B. Mother. Therfore the affinity and tie which we have even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to nature with her exceeds all affinity among men. And if men upon this ſcore of alliance by blood and kindred do mutually help one another, and have recourſe to them for reliefe in diſtreſs; why ſhall not we have recourſe to her, with whome we are linkt in the ſtraiteſt bonds?</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay of the neernes, and as it were ſpiritual kindred which we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with her? he by whom thou receivedſt the grace of baptiſme, or ſtood for God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to thee in that Sacrament, becomes thy kinſman and thou art bound to honour him as thy parent; how much ſtricter a propinquity and filiation contract we with the Virgin by whoſe meanes we have ſo often receivd grace, who hath ſo frequently brought us forth to God, and into the light and truth of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life?</p>
                  <p>I acknowledg thee, o Mother of God, Mother of grace and mercy for my Mother, and beſeech thee, that thou wilt not forget that ſweet name in which thou thy ſelf takeſt ſo much complacence. Thou art ſtild Mother of grace and mercy; and what ennobled thee
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:39021:86"/> with this title but our miſery, becauſe we ſtand in ſuch need of thy grace and commiſe-ration? wherfore ſince I am the moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all, I challenge a greater right over thy maternal bowels then all. Thy dignity accrues from my indignity, thy ſanctity from my ſinfulnes: and therfore I claime the firſt place in thy mercy, becauſe I am the firſt and greateſt and unworthieſt of ſinners. The ſins of men made thee the Mother of God: and my ſins alone were ſufficient to make thee the Mother of mercy: diſcard me not from thy protection, ſince all the Religious of our Society are ſhelterd under thy mantle, as thy moſt devoted child F. Martin Gutierez beheld once in a wonderful viſion. For who can lay a better claime to mercy then he that is moſt miſerable? remember that I alone by my innumerable offences, can only maintain this title of honour in which next to that of a Virgin Mother thou art wonto glory above all others. I that am moſt miſerable confide, o Mother, in thy mercy: for heaven and earth wil ſooner periſh, then thy mercy and grace wil fruſtrate thoſe that truly and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly implore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Admit me among them, that with joyfulnes and teares I may employ my ſelf in honouring thee: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my tepidity keeps me cold and dul, as one that am wholy of an earthly complexion, I envy thy clients a little of their fervour; and wiſh, as did that moſt devout Father Iohn
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:39021:87"/> Trexus, to ſweep thy chappells with my mouth and water them with my teares. And to accompliſh this in deed, that good zealous Father and devout child of the Virgin made on foot a pilgrimage of ſome miles.</p>

It might ſuffice to make us eternally condole &amp; compaſſionate with IESVS, and loathingly abhor all ſelf-ſeeking appetites, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd what torture he ſufferd that laſt night and day of his life in all his members, there being no whole bit to be found in him from the ſole of the foot to the crown of his head. His tongue which the torments left untouchd, that it might not go ſcotfree ſeems to have ſhard as deeply as any of the reſt: for the moſt patient IESVS complaind of no disjoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings anguiſh of his limbs but only of his thirſt: to let us underſtand, that even thoſe parts which ſeemd to be vacant, wanted not alſo their torment. Neither did the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſenes of the pain ſtupify or benum them; but all were preſervd ſtrong; lively, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, that they might be more able to ſuffer: and therfore he being ready to give up the ghoſt cryed out with a loud voice; wherby alſo he gave a remonſtrance of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-relenting fervour with which he ſollicited our cauſe amidſt ſuch bitter torments; and of the humble acquieſcency wherewith he accepted death by the bowing of his head; and the profound reſpect and reverence he uſd in fulfilling his Fathers precept ſo ful of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:39021:88"/>
                  <p> Notwithſtanding all this we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moſt feelingly what he ſufferd all his life long in that one little member of his moſt holy Hart: whoſe paine was unſufferably great even from the firſt moment of his conception, and continued ſo all the time of his life. It was his hart that did firſt and laſt partake of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was ſo much the more feelingly reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentive, by how much the unſupportable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of all the reſt of his members met in it, the moſt delicate of all others, as in their center. No les affliction harbourd in the hart of IESVS from that moment, then he felt in the garden when he ſwet blood through his whole body. And even as there he was ſiezd after an unwonted and frightful manner with a lively apprehenſion of all the anguiſh and paines of his paſſion; ſo alſo no les inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely did he apprehend the ſame in the womb of his moſt loving mother. For Chriſts know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg was not obnoxious to any imperfection, at that time eſpecially when he took upon him the grand affair of our redemption; and all the difficulty he was to undergo and break through, was without any diſſimulation clearly repreſented to his underſtanding. He did there moſt perfectly apprehend all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his ſufferings, the innumerable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of his whole life, his contempts and revilements; and from that time this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was as afflictive (and perchance more, if there could be any inequality) as it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the garden: for there the ſenſe of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:39021:89"/> paine broke out and diffuſd it ſelf through all his body; in ſuch ſort that the anguiſh diſperſd through the whole did remaine les pungent in the hart: but in the womb of the moſt glorious Virgin, the whole ſea of grief was confined within the narrow channel of one ſmal member, the little tender hart of the infant IESVS. When one ſheds teares he is les ſenſible of an affliction, then when the anguiſh is ſhut up and ſmotherd in the hart, the eyes remaining dry and tearles: ſo Chriſt when he did not ſweat, nor the blood trickld out, ſorrowd perchance more becauſe no particle at all of that ſorrow did evaporate; nevertheles it was behoofful for our inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſhew once exteriourly how much he continually ſufferd interiourly. That grief accompanyd him all along through the whole courſe of his life. IESVS enjoyd alwaies a moſt perfect and intuitive knowledg of all things as they are in themſelves. Vnles by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine priviledg and diſpenſation he had bin particularly aſsiſted, the intenſenes of the pain had cauſd death in that firſt inſtant he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to live: and therfore his whole life was a ſignal and continual miracle. Neither did his own Paſsion alone afflict him, but much more his compaſsion over others: he was moved to it, while he conſiderd the diſtreſs of his moſt loving and innocent Mother: he was moved to it in behalf of us: he reſented more feelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly the torments of Martyrs, the auſterities of confeſſours, the diſcaſes and maladies of his
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:39021:89"/> Saints, then they themſelves who did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go them. If an affectionate Mother do more grieve at the ſicknes of her child then the child himſelf: who can deny but Chriſt loved his more tenderly then any mother doth her only child. He did truly bear our labours, &amp; our griefes did he ſuſtain. How great then muſt his pain needs be, if it ſurpaſs that of Martyrs, Penitents, and ſick folks comprizd in one? But above the reſt he was touchd with a lively compaſsion over us, for all and each particular ſin of all and each particular man, who hath been or ſhal be to the worlds end: The immenſity of this pain will ſtrike him that conſiders it into amazement; it being able, if it had not been miraculouſly ſuſpended, to have a thouſand times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaud him of life. If ſome men have ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowd ſo intenſely for their ſins that the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of their contrition cauſd death; how could it be but that the ſorrow of IESVS for one alone, and that the leaſt venial ſin, of any one man, muſt needs extinguiſh life in him; he penetrating ſo perfectly the deformity of the fault, as alſo the majeſty of God his Father who is offended, and the baſenes of man the offender, and loving ſo ardently both the one and the other? as no body can reach the hight of this his charity, ſo neither can any ſound the depth of his ſorrow. If he conceivd ſo great griefe for one venial ſin, how much will he conceive for all and every venial and mortal ſo horrid and abominable? he bore an unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:39021:90"/> weight of ſin who impoſd upon us a ſweet yoak and a light burden; and we charge IESVS with the abominable fardel of our iniquities which forced a bloody ſweat from his body, as the preſs doth wine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bunch of grapes. If any one ſhould have ſufferd all the torments of Martyrs, all the diſeaſes and anguiſh of all men, even from the firſt day of Adams tranſgreſſion til ſuch time as Chriſt comes to judgment; all this would not be equivalent to his paine; which alſo upon this ſcore that it was ſpiritual, was bitterer in its kind then any corporal affliction whatſoever. The fulnes of the Divinity reſided in Chriſt, and the clear viſion of God did illuſtrate him: which nevertheles obſtructed not ſome effects; but it was miraculouſly ſo orderd, leaſt by it a tyde of joy ſhould over flow his whole body and the inferiour portion of his ſoul, that place might be left for ſorrow as it fel out in his ſacred Paſsion. But in the hart of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS grieving for our offences, it did not only give way to extreme ſadnes, but did extremely augment it, by reaſon of his perfect knowledg of God offended: for how much more perfect this knowledg was, it cauſd a ſorrow ſo much greater; and CHRIST alone had a more perfect intuitive knowledg of God, then all the Cherubins &amp; Seraphins, then all the other Angels and Saints in heaven. Chriſts love alſo towards God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended was correſponding to the viſion of the divine Majeſty, wherfore his ſorrow exceeds
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:39021:90"/> the comprehenſion either of word or thought; for he let no opportunity ſlip of ſuffering as much as he could, and was beſeeming him to ſuffer: yea prodigious miracles were wrought in his moſt holy ſoul, that ſorrow might have its ful effect. Why then are we ſo ſollicitous to compaſs joyes, and rack ourwits ſo much in the ſearch of new pleaſures, if IESVS ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd all this in his hart, which none ought to think upon without teares, and each good Chriſtian ought to make it the theam of his thought.</p>
                  <p>How dareſt thou, o my hart, ſlacken the raines to joy? conſider the cauſe why thy IESVS ſufferd? it was for thy offences that he might work thy ſalvation. Becauſe I treſpaſſd, therfore he loves me ſo tenderly and confers bleſſings upon me. Why doth not this lover of me and benefactour to his enemies, heap coales of fire upon my head, &amp; make me bluſh at my own proceedings? why doth he not heap coales of fire upon my hart, that I may burn with love of him and a deſire of his imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. I wil place the ſad hart of IESVS up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my obdurate hart, that he may find me at length according to his hart, a frend and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of ſuffering. Compaſſionate, o my hart, with the ſuffering IESVS, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him in his ſufferings. How wilt thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy by the ſufferings of Chriſt, if thou haſt not compaſſion over Chriſt ſuffering? be not unmindful of ſuch a courteſy from thy ſuerty. S. Iames Guiſay not to be unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:39021:91"/> of it, beſides his daily meditation and other devotions to it, carried it alwaies about him written in a little Book, in token that it was engraven in his hart and faild no day to read it over. This memory of his Saviours croſs was ſo acceptable to Almighty God, that he vouchſafed him, after his entrance into the Society, a true conformity with it, that is, to be crucified for his ſake, and by his ſufferings to adumbrate the death of his B. Son: and Chriſt was not backward in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſing the devotion of the Saint: for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place where he and many other Saints were crucified, miraculous lights were ſeen every friday in the ayre, approving and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting the comformablenes of their ſuffering with that of Chriſt. The memory of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is grateful to him and that we might have a perpetual memorial of it before our eyes, he inſtituted the admirable Sacrament of his moſt holy Body.</p>
                  <p>But if thou be midful of Chriſt ſuffering, why art thou not unſufferable to thy ſelf, and hartily angry at thy own proceedings. The king of Moab ſorely ſtraitned by the ſiege of the Iſraelites, being quite out of hope of all relief, took his eldeſt Son who was to ſucceed him in his throne and offerd him in holocauſt upon the wals: and it cauſd ſuch a commotion &amp; indignation in the Iſraelits camp that forth with they raiſd their ſiege and departed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the holocauſt of the firſt and only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God upon the altar of the croſs!
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:39021:91"/> why art thou not repleniſhd with diſdain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy ſelf, quitting all ſelf will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? we uſe to compaſſionate even externs yea even brute beaſts; why do we not ſo to our God, to our Father, to our brother? o our ſhameles obſtinacy! who, inſteed of commiſerating him, crucify IESVS again by new offences! remember that God is thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not thy foe; that he ſuffers for thee his foe, not for the beaſts of the field or their ſalvation; for thee not for himſelf, the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſt of all puniſhments, wounded in all his members, not only afflicted with ſome ſmal ach of his head or ſtomack; becauſe he did thee and the world a good turne, not becauſe he put cities into combuſtion; publickly on a day of ſolemnity and in a mountain betwixt two thieves as their captain and ringleader, not in a by-corner and ſecretly, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all mens hatred diſgrace and ſcorne; in ſo much that the mercy of men was wanting to him alone who is mercy it ſelf. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he ſuffers willingly and lovingly, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedly not frettingly not complainingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was for thee; of his own people not of barbarians and Scythians; for the ſpace of 33. yeares, not for an hour or two. Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate then with IESVS, and make not all he has done fruitles: forbear to offend him, begin to imitate him: and that his Paſsion may truly benefit thee, make it the model of thy imitation.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>GOD doth not tempt us though he hath made our ſalvation ful of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Nothing is more acceptable to him, he having done and ſufferd ſo much, then that we imitate him. The words of a man placed in autority are held for lawes and muſt be fulfild; why are the deeds of God leſs obſervable? he that ſets the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and moſt ſorrowful hart of Chriſt as a ſignet upon his own, let him ſet it alſo upon his arme that he may imitate what he commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerates. Love is not ſoft and effeminate but ſtrong and maſculin, and the croſs of Chriſt will crucify Gods zealot by compaſsion and emulation. The imitation of Chriſt is harsh and unſavory: ſome have it in as much hatred as hell it ſelf, but for all that we cannot emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late better graces. Fear no coſenage when he perſwades thee to take the croſs for thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, diſgrace for thy honour, poverty for riches; he is the prime and undoubted truth. The eternal wiſdome and divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect hath ſo orderd, hath judgd it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. Be not diffident, he is the ſupreme goodnes and higheſt power; by theſe never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles he redeemd thee, and by the ſame thou
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:39021:92"/> muſt complete thy ſalvation: that work is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun &amp; accompliſhed by the ſame inſtruments: by theſe Chriſt aſcended into heaven; and the members muſt not think of going another way then by which the head leads them. They are not poyſon; Chriſt himſelf ſanctified them and taſted them firſt of all himſelf: yea that a ſmal parcel of them might only paſs to us, he drunk up almoſt the whole chalice of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and afflictions; and yet for all that, he lives eternally and ſits at the right hand of God. How canſt thou but be confounded, whilſt ſeing Chriſt accurſed by all, thou ſeekeſt ſo much to be honoured and praiſd? behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him proſtrate at the feet of Iudas, thou preferſt thy ſelf before thy betters? ſeing him thirſty and in want of a little water, thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets plenty and delicate fare?</p>
                  <p>It is the greateſt glory of a ſervant to follow his maſters footſteps. To imitate Chriſt is a buſines not only of neceſsity but dignity: and for this reſpect the main difficulty is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and a ſufficient reward allotted for others that occur. If it be a credit to imitate Chriſt, then it wil not be difficult to ſuffer contempt and the revilements of men: for that wil be a high point of honour; and there is no contempt, where it is a credit to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. It wil be alſo no hard matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar ones ſelf of pleaſures and ſuperfluous ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to obtaine true glory: for worldlings &amp; even heathens did more then this, when they abſtaind even from neceſſaries for a ſeeming &amp;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:39021:93"/> only apparent glory. Let it confound us that ſome barbarians have bin found ſo loyal and loving to their ſoveraign, that if he wanted eyes, they would put out theirs; if he wanted hands, they in like manner would cut of theirs; and gave this as a pledge of their fidelity and imitation in others: why do not we that are calld the faithful, imitate the king of glory, in things of far les difficulty? If Chriſt had only told us what we were to do, though he had not held forth the torch of example, we were to have done it: how much more when he did it firſt himſelf, and did it to the end we might do it after him; and not only ſaid ſo in a word, but made large encomiums of the happines of afflictions. If a Prophet had but intimated it, we could pretend no excuſe; and how much les can we, when the very wiſdom of Prophets, and Gods own mouth hath exaggeratively recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and made himſelf a model of it? IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS never let fal the leaſt idle word, and yet he leſt ſo many prayſes and magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeeche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the happines of poverty and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction? if it behooud us not to ſuffer, the examplary life of IESVS would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and his auſterity wholly unuſeful to us, who ſhould be unſenſible of his charity who payd ſuch a vaſt and ſuperabundant ſum for our ranſome, neither ſhould we be taught by ſo lively an example to love his imitation, and deteſt all ſin and ſenſual pleaſures. Would God have needleſly thruſt his only begotten
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:39021:93"/> Son upon ſuch thornes, if it imported noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all to do what he did, that thoſe whom he preelected and predeſtinated might be made conforme to the image of his Son, that he may be the firſt begotten among many brethren? God is not a God of impiety, as who could take complacence in being ſo cruel towards his only beloved child. Fierce and ſavage crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are moſt paſsionately tender over their young ones: and how could God, who is moſt meek and ful of mercy; be ſo tyrannically cruel towards his Son, if it were not needful for us to ſuffer. The enormity of our ſins exacted not ſuch heavy penalties for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: one drop I will not ſay of IESVS blood but of his ſweat was ſuperabundant. It was therfore our behoof of imitating Chriſt and ſuffering (it being the road way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) that requird ſuch outragious torments and rigour of life. God is either cruel and impious, or elſe it is altogether needful for us to be humble, afflicted, and needy, to have a high eſteem of divine charity, and a meane one of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>No body knowes the way to heaven who hath not gone it: no body aſcends up to heaven but he who deſcended from heaven Chriſt Ieſus; &amp; who treads the path which he chalkd forth. It was a way wholly unknown, nor could any give better directions then Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus who knew it &amp; had gone it. Ieſus did not as ſome peaſants do, who with their fingar or ſpeech point out the way to travellers while
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:39021:94"/> they themſelves ſit quietly at home, no whit ſollicitous whether afterwards they hit or miſs: for beſides that by word he had taught the path that carries to heaven, he goes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before and leads the way that we may be ſecure from errour. Tel me, if we were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly aſſurd, as now we are, that there were ſuch a thing as heavenly joyes, and that one were to go thither on foot, and no more were requird to compaſs theſe joyes, but only to know the way which he is wholly ignorant of, and another good body ſhould inſtruct him in that; who would not buckle himſelf to this journey, though crabbed and ruggy, eſpecially if he that ſhewd us the way would accompany us and go before? why then do we not believe Chriſt and follow him? do we feare, the wiſdome of God being our guide, to go aſtray? do we think we can miſcarry our B. Saviour going before? no certainly. Chriſt ſhewd us a ſecure path, and traced it out to us, ſo ſecure, that although we die in it, the very danger and death breeds ſecurity: yea if thou didſt love Chriſt, thou wouldſt not ſtick to die with him. He loves not Chriſt who doth not imitate him, for the vertue of love is aſſimilation or reſemblance. O that one could truly ſay; I live, now not I, but Chriſt liveth in me: carrying the mortification of IESVS about in my body and implanting it in my ſoul!</p>
                  <p>If then thou loveſt the Son of Mary &amp; wilt become his tabernacle as ſhe was; behold with
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:39021:94"/> accuratenes and do according to the pattern which is propoſd to thee in the mount Calva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and take a view of the whole life of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS. He choſe to live and die in contempt, he was derided and ſet with the wicked, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not only an idiot but a fool: he was beaten as one would not beat his ſlave, he was puniſhd as if he had been the worſt of crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals: of his own accord he ſhund all temporal honour when it was exhibited: ther was no miſcalling or ſlanderous nickname that was not appropriated to him: they calld him Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan, idolater, poſſeſſd perſon, falſe Prophet, ſeducer, belly. God, devourer, drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of wine, blaſphemer and tranſgreſſour of the law: he was thought to be a traitor and conſpiratour againſt his country, a friend and abettour of ſinners. What creature can be namd, to which he did not humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? He humbled himſelf to the Angels: what need was there that an Angel ſhould come to comfort him who was God, ſince with one ſole word he could have deſtroid the whole frame of this univerſe? what needed he ſay that legions of Angels would vindicate his cauſe and gainſtand his apprehenders, as if he himſelf had been unable? what need when he was faſting and hungry, to take a little meat and as it were an almes from the Angels; ſince the leaſt word of his mouth could turne ſtones into loaves of bread. He humbled himſelf to men, being obedient &amp; ſubject to his mother and Ioſeph. He humbled himſelf to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:39021:95"/> Princes Herod, Ceſar, Caiphas, Pilate, by fulfilling their unjuſt commands &amp; obeing their decrees and impoſitions. He humbled himſelf to the vileſt of men and very ſervants as Malchus, his executioners, and others. He humbled himſelf to all creatures permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heat, cold, iron, thornes, reeds, ſpittle &amp; the croſs to exerciſe their rigour upon him. He laſtly ſubjected himſelf to the very divels: in the time of his Paſſion he was delivered over to the power of darknes, and he ſufferd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be carried up by the divel to the pinnacle of the temple. Thers no creature from the nobleſt to the meaneſt, from the beſt to the worſt, to which my Creatour ſubjected not himſelf for my ſake: and he that made all things and was Lord of all, would have noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he might have me: he poſſeſſd no mannours, he had no yearly revenues; even of almes he took les then neceſſity exacted: he went apparelld not like a philoſopher or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour or nobleman, but after the manner of a poor beggar: he was alſo in penury of true friends; in ſo much that no intreaty was made to ſave him from ſo much as one box on the eare: he diveſted himſelf of his kingdom and principality, he himſelf becoming the mask and guize of his own Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>In as much alſo as he was God he gave us like documents of humility. That redoubted infinitude and awful omnipotency is moſt conſpicuous for its humility. For mans ſake it made choiſe of theſe things which have
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:39021:95"/> more of labour and les of credit: when he created man he would not make him as he had done the reſt of creatures by one commanding word of ſoveraignty but by ſerving &amp; moiling with his hands, as if he had been ſome potter or labourer. In the work alſo of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he would not ranſome us, as he might, by aſſuming ſome noble and refind nature, as that of a Seraphin, but he would eſpouſe the meaneſt of all rationals, infamous, and in diſgrace for the diſloialty of our firſt parent, and falling of it ſelf into decay and ruin. In his glorification when he is to ſatiate us with the glory of his majeſty, and as ſupreme Lord, give a full and final reward, he tels us he wil play the ſerving-man and wait. For Chriſt is truly the Son of God, and both taught and practiſd the faſhions of God in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding. The Father acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſpirit of humility in his Son deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid: behold my ſervant I wil receive him, I have breathd my ſpirit upon him. We never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles who glory in being Chriſtians, and ſeek to be entitled the children of God, ſhun thoſe things, which Chriſt the Son of God loved ſo dearly. How could we hate poverty, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity &amp; the croſſ more hartily, if Chriſt ſhould command it under paine of damnation, then we now do, when for them he hath promiſd a reward of glory? our eares are as open to the lies of the world, and we as pliable to the ſuggeſtions of the divel, as if he had bin cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifid for our ſakes: and we ſo loath Chriſts
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:39021:96"/> manner of life, and ſet as little by his counſels as if ſome fool or raving buffoon had blabd them out at randome in the market place.</p>
                  <p>If any earthly king ſhould offer far les pay to his ſoldiers, they would without reply follow him through all kind of waies and weather: eſpecially if he ſhould treat them no otherwiſe for diet, lodging, &amp; apparrel then he doth himſelf, they would ſerve him gratis and meerly to avoid ſhame; &amp; we can be mov'd neither by love nor ſhame, nor fear nor gain, to follow the king of kings and Lord of Lords. O that I were as faithful to Chriſt as was that young eſquier to Ionathas! do ſaid he, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſeems good to thy mind, go whither ſoever thou wilt and I will wait upon thee through all. He forced his paſſage through rocks, through drawn ſwords, through the enemies camp, and all this that the kings Son might not go alone. But Ionathas mounted the hil creeping upon his hands and feet, and his eſquier followd cloſe after him. Why do we leave CHRIST to tread the winepreſs alone, and no body accompanies him in his labours and ſufferings. What we are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to undergo for Chriſt is nothing ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, as what that eſquier attempted for Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathas. What ſouldier would deſert his king in the midſt of an enemy army, and could have the face to return home wel and jocund, and would not rather chuſe to fal by his ſide? and why do we leave Chriſt all alone? he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines not without reaſon: I have trod the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:39021:96"/> winepreſs alone, and of nations no one man aſſiſted me. Although a ſouldier by ſtaying with his king could bring him no reſcue nor himſelf relief, yet he were not in duty to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him: how much leſs oughtſt thou, ſince ſo great advantage accrues to thee, ſo great comfort to the king of kings Chriſt Ieſus in his ſufferings, and the end intended is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhd, which is his imitation. We muſt either renounce the name of a Chriſtian, or imbrace that which makes a Chriſtian. If thou refuſe to follow Chriſt, whom wilt thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? it can be no other then the Prince of this world the divel. He that traceth the foot ſteps of IESVS ſhuns ſuch a leader and guide; in ſo much that he ought to do ſo only to ſhun him: he followes ſuch a guide that he were to follow him, although thereby he ſhund no other evil; and how much more when theſe two are linkt together to follow what is beſt and ſhun what is worſt, to follow God and ſhun the divel.</p>
                  <p>Its only long of our own malice that we do not what Chriſt did and taught. No body can excuſe himſelf upon the pretence of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency: our ſalvation and perfection is placed in theſe things, which every one may have if he liſt: every one may be poor, every one may be patient; its in every ones free choiſe not to be ambitious of honours. This is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and love of God to make choiſe of thoſe things that are obvious to all, and which all may compaſs with ſmal labour. He excludes
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:39021:97"/> no man from his kingdom, neither would he have any one want what is requiſite for its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. If he had placed our ſalvation in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours riches, and pleaſures, more would be damnd then now are; for the number of the poor, ignoble, and oppreſsd are without number, and in that caſe would yet be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for the more they were that ſought to be rich and happy, the fewer would attain their deſire. What then ſhal I now ſay to thee? if thou wilt not imbrace the poverty, humility, and croſs of IESVS, or ſee'ſt not the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable good that is acquird by his imitation, but that this is it which he himſelf ſaith; he that followes me walks not in darknes? thou ſee'ſt it not becauſe thou walkſt in darknes whilſt thou followeſt another guide then IESVS.</p>

The Apoſtles went re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing from the ſight of the councel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were thought worthy to ſuffer a contumely for the name of IESVS. S.

If IESVS, when in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to Mount Calvary he fel under his burden, had willd thee to bear it for him, wouldſt thou have denied him that courteſy? what if he had layd it on thy ſhoulders with his own hands, wouldſt thou have withſtood him &amp; caſt it of? or rather have kiſsd that horrid piece of wood, and adord thoſe ſacred hands that loaded thee? certainly thou wouldſt not only have been content to bear the croſs, but have earneſtly ſought and coveted to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in his place. Behold God hath impoſed upon thee the croſs of this grief, of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, of this needines, why doſt thou reject it? it is lighter then the croſs of Chriſt.

The mind in unſpotted and Virgin fleſh is as it were in a flowry and fragrant mead. Chaſt bodies are the delights of God, what wonder if they be healthful to their ſoules? They let their mind attend wholly to God free from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of temporal things; they exhila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the conſcience in a loathſomnes of all ſenſual pleaſures, loving God, without let or obſtacle. O my love, o moſt pure and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere truth, I am endebted to thee, o God, not only for the half of my hart but for the whole; I will not onely purify my mind but alſo ſanctify my body. We are members of Chriſt: let not one corrupted and unſeemly limb defile and miſhape a moſt beautiful body. Who would prize the beauty of a graceful ſpouſe, if ſhe had a putrid noſe or a face and cheeks which were a receptacle of wormes. Chriſts glorified body is a thouſand times
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:39021:101"/> more pure and refulgent then the Sun. O mortal man, thou art a member of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal CHRIST: conſider how much thou oughteſt to regard the ſanctity of thy body, and to thy utmoſt imitate immortality and incorruption, leaſt thou be diſagreeing from his purity. Thou art made one ſpirit and one fleſh with Chriſt by the communion of his moſt H. Body: do not defile thy own fleſh which by a wonderful kind of real union is become the fleſh of Chriſt. Thou wouldſt deem it no les then a ſacriledge, if one ſhould clothe the ſtatua of a Saint in a ſpotted &amp; naſty garment: why art not thou at leaſt aſhamed to defile that fleſh which is a part of the living Chriſt, and add an obſcene and polluted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to it? thou thy ſelf wouldſt not weare a piece even of royal purple, if it were ſteept in dirt and clay: and why wilt thou weare thy own fleſh ſtaind ſo pittifully with filthy blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes, and make it a part of Chriſts body?</p>
                  <p>As both our ſoul and body ſhal in the next life glorify God in unſpeakable purity, ſo muſt we in this alſo ſtrive to ſerve him in cleanenes of both. Thou muſt not only ſeek beatitude by the ſanctity of thy ſoul; but muſt endeavour alſo to merit the felicity and reſurrection of thy body by the ſanctity of thy fleſh; leaſt ſiding with thy mortal part, at the inſtigation of ſome pleaſant object, thou ſentence thy ſelf to a perpetual death. But learn now ſo to behave thy ſelf in fleſh, as that thou mayſt reſemble the Angelicall ſpirits
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:39021:101"/> who ſhall neither marry nor be married. Learn now the incorruptibility and being of a ſingle nature and life abſtracted from all ſenſe. Thy body muſt emulate the purity of the celeſtial Thrones, in whom God hath ſeated himſelf; ſince it is the temple of the H. Ghoſt, choſen to be a veſſel of honour. We are the good odour of Chriſt: Chriſt breathes purity every where; his attendance is Virginity, his delight chaſtity. In almoſt all the calamities of this world chaſtity was, as it were, a lenitive to God &amp; a repayrer of its dammages: he found an excellent way of repayring the ruines of the Angels chiefly &amp; principally out of Virgins &amp; chaſt perſons, &amp; by them; chuſing a Virgin Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Precurſour, having his Diſciples and the peers of his Church, &amp; the more eminent part of his Saints, for the moſt part Virgins, or living in continency, or without the uſe of their wives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſeparated from them, and all of them moſt chaſt: he mitigated the ſad diſaſter of Adams fal, with the hopes of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that was to bruize the head of the Serpent: thoſe whom he ſaved in the deluged world kept chaſtity while they were in the Ark: Chriſt ſolaced himſelf upon the croſs with his B. Mother and beloved Diſciple both Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. How can he chuſe but love chaſtity &amp; Virginity, both his Parents being Virgins &amp; he having all his being derived from Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Chriſt had a Virgin Father according to his divine nature; and a Virgin Mother ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humane. He would moreover
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:39021:102"/> have the type and ſubſtitute of his Father, to wit S. Ioſeph, a Virgin, though he were to beare onely the name and title of parent. He made choyſe of two Virgins Abel and Iſaac for figures of his innocency and obedience: The firſt fruits that were purchaſed by the blood of the lamb were Virgins, and ſo they follow him whitherſoever he goes; whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they do or ſay, imitating Chriſt and his modeſty which was ſo rare, that nothing was ever objected againſt him in that behalf. And when the Iewes invented many lyes againſt IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS, and heaped many aſperſions upon him without any ſhew of probability, yet they never taxed him for impurity, though they knew him to have held conferences with woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by reaſon of his rare modeſty and the ſhamefaſt compoſure of his countenance, which alone cleard all ſuſpicion and calumny of les exact chaſtity. A meane is chiefly to be obſerved in the ſight for as S. Orontius ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth</p>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:39021:103"/> of merit then the Angels: he gave thee a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that thou mighteſt have ſo many organs of merit, to wit ſo many croſſes as it hath ſenſes and powers of the ſoul: he priviledgd thee above the Angels with that charge of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and creditted to thee the carrying of that muddy lump of earth into heaven. One only care was committed to the Angels, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their ſpirit, which was a ſingle one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and intire: but a double burden was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the ſoul of man though of a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler nature, both to raiſe it ſelf and its trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome fleſh, to an equality with the Angels &amp; heavenly glory.

                  <p>In this ſtate of mortality, after the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of our redemption by the Son of God, Saints are no les eminent then they would have been in the ſtate of innocency: wherfore they become equally holy in this ſhortnes of life, as they would have been in the ſpace of many ages, had men ſtil remaind immortal. The multitude of afflictions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the grace of IESVS recompenſeth the multitude of yeares. The redemption of Chriſt was more copious then the damage we ſuſtaind by our prevarication; and yet for all that, he would not free us from the neceſſities and incumbrances of our fleſh, nor wholly extinguiſh the rebellion of our appetites, leaſt he might deprive his elect of a very compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way of meritting; that by this meanes he might preſent them to his heavenly Father in a ſhorter time, loaden with equal or greater merits, then could otherwiſe have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in many ages. He who vanquiſhd the world by the croſs will have thee to vanquiſh thy ſelf by the ſame. The copious grace of Chriſt triumphs moſt in a thwart and reluctant nature: and it helps it ſelf by that very reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy to increaſe its merits. The ſtronger the enemy is, the more glorious is the triumph:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:39021:104"/> therfore it muſt not be burdenſome to thee to he burdenſome to thy ſelf: but enjoy this thy violence and patience upon all occaſions of meritting, in overcoming, in ſacrificing, in crucifying thy ſelf in all things. Let not the grace of Chriſt be idle and ineffectual in thee. Combat and the croſs is neceſſary to make thee good whether thou wilt or no. Some great commanders after they had landed their men, burnt or deſtroid their ſhipping, that all hopes of returne being quite cut of, their ſouldiers might fight more reſolutely: in the ſame manner God hath tied an enemy to us. Why do we hope to avoid all combat? the neceſſity of combatting muſt neceſſitate us to victory and merit. Chriſt redeemd us by his croſs, and by it we muſt be ſaved, dying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually that we may live and vanquiſh by our patience. The way of ſalvation is rightly tearmd the way of perdition: deſtroy and ſeal up thy ſenſes with the ſignet of Chriſts croſs and they ſhal be in ſecurity, blindfold thy ſelf or rather put out thy eyes, and thy ſight wil be much better: become deaf and thou ſhalt hear with facility: become mute and thou ſhalt ſpeak wel; heep thy ſelf faſting and thou ſhalt relliſh wel; be without hands and employment, and thou ſhalt labour wel; be odious to thy ſelf and thou ſhalt love wel; be dead to the world, and thou ſhalt live wel; be fearful and thou ſhalt be ſecure; be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to thy ſelf and thou ſhalt be honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; be laborious and thou ſhalt enjoy repoſe,

                  <p>O truth, o moſt loving IESVS, if I love thee, how can I hate that croſs which thou lovedſt ſo ardently! how can I ſhun that croſs which none but divels ſhun who hate thee? it is the divels task to fly from the croſs; it is Chriſts to die upon it: let a Chriſtian conſider whether of theſe two he ought to imitate? let him be ſure to imbrace ſelf-victory and ſelf denyal, and not divide himſelf for a trifling pleaſure or the diſturbance of a petty incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity from Chriſt, depriving himſelf of ſo much merit and ſatisfaction. Do not go about to excuſe thy ſelf from that which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inexcuſable: although thou be one of the elect, thou muſt ſuffer either in this life or in purgatory, where patience is extremely barren. If one muſt needs ſuffer, judge whether it wil be more commodious to do it in this life, where with light afflictions thou redeemeſt exceſſive torments, and ſins, and moreover gaineſt glory by increaſing thy merits: or in purgatory where by vaſt ſufferings thou makeſt but ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſatisfaction, &amp; meriteſt nothing at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides? in purgatory there is no merit, ſmall ſatisfaction, huge puniſhment; but in this life the puniſhment is extreme eaſy, the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction great and merit moſt ample. What marchant would buy wares at ſuch a time when they are both worſt and deareſt; and not rather when he may have them in a manner for nothing?</p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:39021:105"/>
                  <p> But above all love to ſuffer for love of Chriſt. Is there any one, that having once imbraced him would relinquiſh him for that cup of water which David powred upon the ground? tell me, o thou lover and zealer of Ieſus; if thou wert naild on the other ſide of Chriſts croſs back to back with thy beloved, crucified together with him for the glory of God on mount Calvary; and if ſome ſhould make promiſe of belief in him &amp; to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg him for the Son of God if he would deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, &amp; he for all that would not deſert thee, nor deſcend; &amp; again, ſome other ſhould offer thee as one would do a child a morſel of meat or an apple, as Eve did Adam, upon condition thou wouldſt deſert the company of thy belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved IESVS; wouldſt thou really deſert and abandon him? o! our arrand ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion! how often do we for a toyiſh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or the fulfilling of our perverſe will relinquiſh the croſs, and leave Chriſt to ſuffer all alone without the comfort of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany?</p>
                  <p>Go to, o my ſoul redeemd by Chriſt upon the croſs, take up thy croſs and follow thy IESVS, and deny thy ſelf: learn ſelf deny al by what it is to deny another: he that is alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from another whether he be kinſman or friend, if he ſee him beaten, or in want, or impriſond, he comes not at him, he ſuccours him not, nor condoles with his diſtreſſed condition: and ſo muſt thou proceed with thy own body and ſtand affected towards it, as if

In no deſire of thy hart nor propenſion of ſenſe muſt thou ſeek thy own content; even as he that is nayld to a croſs hath not power to move any member as he liſteth, nor do what his liſt ſuggeſteth. One that were crucified would have ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to things preſent, nor be ſollicitous for the future; he would not labour to hoard up riches nor beſpeak paſtimes: but would fix his eie only upon the other life, and though as yet living, reckon himſelf among the dead: in ſuch a condition muſt he be that is crucified with Chriſt: he muſt alſo number himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead not only defunct to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and vices of this life but even to life it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>O moſt amiable Lord, if thou be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of poverty, take what is mine, and in the firſt place my ſelf I wiſh I were ſo poor that I were not owner of my ſelf: for he is rich enough who hath himſelf, ſince he is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a man. He that hath relinquiſhd other things and not himſelf doth no great feat in contemning thoſe things which are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but earth and duſt; which for the moſt part contain ſome evill, and by which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come evill; the compaſsing whereof is ful of vexation the poſſeſsion of fear, the deprive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſorrow. It is no great buſines to leave thoſe things that otherwiſe will leave us, and in the interim are many wayes hurtful. Thou o Lord becoming man gaveſt thy ſelf to man for man, that by ſuch traffique thou mighteſt gain man and not the riches of man: man muſt render himſelf into thy hands and not eſteem himſelf more valuable then God. It is a high piece of injuſtice for man to deny himſelf to God who bought him at ſo dear a rate. Man muſt ſet a true eſtimate upon God and retaliate the injury he ſufferd by Iudas who rated him only at 30. Pence. A Chriſtian muſt prize Chriſt more then the whole world and a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rate God higher then it ſelf. He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſheth other things and not himſelf is ſo far from leſſening his deſire, that oftentimes
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:39021:108"/> he more augments it. Privation cauſeth an appetite and want ſtirs up deſire. All things are only a juſt price for him that is all. All things muſt be abandoned in which man himſelf is concerned: for if one retaine an appetite though he relinquiſh the thing it ſelf, his ſmootherd deſire will ſoon revive.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not only relinquiſh the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but the very deſire of them. It is not enough to abandon what thou haſt, but thou muſt moreover not ſeek any thing elſe, nor accept of what is offered or given thee, nor, as much as may be, even borrow things for thy uſe. It is not the propriety but uſe of things that is noxious. Let it be grateful to thee to have leſs then the reſt, avoiding ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity which is a ſtumbling block of ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, laid to the detriment and overthrow of the reſt: It is a ſingular beaſt, or beaſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity which waſts and depopulates the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of our Lord: many religious men are leſs cautious in this behalf: they think their ſpirit is not diſquieted ſo long as they feel no anxiety nor deſire; but when any thing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd and given without perceivance of theſe in themſelves, they deem themſelves free from all danger, eſpecially when they are not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther annoid with ſollicitude of other things. But they are not out of danger: for although there be none in acquiring the thing, yet there is in the uſe and poſſeſsion of it. The things themſelves cauſe an appetite of other things; wherfore although the man himſelf
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:39021:108"/> have no deſire of others yet the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have and they ſtir up an appetite in their poſſeſſour: for one thing is alwaies craving another. Beſides if thou haſt relinquiſhd thy own, why wilt thou have another man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null thy fact? that which thou approvedſt as conforme to the doctrine of Chriſt, why makeſt thou another to diſapprove? it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou intendeſt to diſmiſs &amp; relinquiſh again what is now given thee? thou mayſt make a ſhorter cut then this by not taking it. The chiefeſt prayſe of poverty conſiſts not in leaving much, but in having nothing, &amp; reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing for his own uſe. Why was the glory &amp; commendation of the Apoſtles ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently great? was it perchance becauſe they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandond their poor fiſhing nets, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they retaind nothing? for that indeed is to relinquiſh all. If another importune thee to take any thing, thy poverty muſt contend with his liberality: thou wilt prove thy ſelf a poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, if thou be overcome. Thy own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty over came thy liberality, why cannot it do ſo to anothers? thou didſt rather chuſe to be poor and needy then reſerve any thing of thy own wherwith to be liberal: why pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſt thou anothers liberality before thy own poverty? would he be thought to give good advice who ſhould ſay, keep this that thou mayſt not abandon all: no certainly; neither muſt thou acquieſce to his ſuggeſtions which are repugnant to the counſel of Chriſt. Suppoſe him that gives to ſay in like manner, beware
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:39021:109"/> thou yeald not, but having forſaken thy own do not accept of whats anothers; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne for the love of God, thoſe things alſo which thou haſt not nor art in poſſibility of having. Such a love of poverty is wont to be ingenderd in the ſervants of Chriſt, that if even IESVS himſelf, for whoſe ſake they quitted all, ſhould reſtore them ſomething, or command them to poſſeſs the goods of this world, they would reply, and appeale to the throne of his mercy as deeming that two great a puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>O how rich will he be, who is ſo poor of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that not ſo much as in affection he covets any thing of this world! for as ſoon as he hath made this renouncement of worldly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in his hart, he transfers them into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; becoming Lord of them and ſelling them to Chriſt, without any prejudice at all either to him that ownes them or that hath them in uſe. Such a one is ſtrangely enrichd by thoſe things which neither are his nor ever ſhal be, having treaſures in heaven and no want upon earth for poverty is not burdenſome to him that loves it, but ful of ſweetnes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; unſavory only to them that hate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt it, and what wonder if it be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to its perſecutours and enemyes.

                  <p>PAtience is a thing to be wiſhed above all others: thou muſt regard it more then thy life; for there is a greater ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity of ſuffering then can be of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Thou art not born to live easfully for a time but thou liveſt that thou mayſt ſuffer for a time, and thou ſuffereſt for a time that thou mayſt live eternally. Thou art born to a life which ſhall not be interrupted; it is requiſite then that in this its interim thou ſuffer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption. This life is not for it ſelf: for neither do paſſengers travel that they may only be ſayd to be in motion: we live for a more ſublime end. What is this life but toile and labour, to which man is born that by it he may purchaſe beatitude; God could have created us in glory: what needed we fetch ſuch a circuit about &amp; paſs through ſo many wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, unles we were to go by the path of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:39021:110"/> to life then patience becauſe nothing is more obvious in it then ſufferance. In trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which cannot be avoided it is a lenitive &amp; aſſwageth griefe, which impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce augmenteth. Thou mightſt have ſome pretext for being impatient, if thy impatience would eaſe the affliction, but it is a thing beyond all excuſe to forfeit the ample fruits of patience, which thou mightſt reape almoſt out of every action and adverſity, without any fruit at all. Do not omit nor performe thy vertuous exerciſes perfunctoriouſly, by reaſon of any incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of this life, or the hard meaſure thou haſt from men; for it would be eſteemed injuſtice to make God pay for an injury done thee by man. God who is innocent muſt not ſatisfy for the default of the nocent.</p>
                  <p>If thou inure thy ſelf to take theſe tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions patiently, thou ſhalt become after a manner impaſſible, and a lover of afflictions. Fire doth not burn aſhes, nor ſuffer they any harme from it; they rather love the fire, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and help to its conſervation: ſo the more patient one is, the more joy many times by a certain divine priviledg, doth he feel in his greateſt preſſures. Patience doth not leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the labour but the pain, and thats enough: it is ſo deſerving at our hands, that it wil not defraud us of any part of our merits, but only aſſwage the noy ſomenes of the affliction: &amp; ſo it hath found a meanes to make us enjoy both the fruits of our labours and not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſtated with the labours themſelves. God

God ſhewes no greater argument of love, nor imparts any guift with more tendernes and affection of hart then labours &amp; the bitter croſs of his B.

The moſt loving hart of Chriſt expected revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement and miſery: and how canſt thou be his diſciple if thou hate and ſhun it? ſeek not to beloved by God upon other motives then was his only-beloved Son; nor covet to affect any thing beſides what he loved and affected.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt not be patient enought, unles thou deſire practiſe of patience, which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance: thou wilt be but half-patient if thou only beare the wrong done thee, unles thou be alſo ambitious of them; but this without any others default. To what end makeſt thou thy complaints? the true patient ſpeaks not of his wrongs, nor makes rehearſals of his aggrievances to another; becauſe he placeth not his comfort in excuſes and condolements, but ſtands indifferent whether his griefe be eaſed or no. Why reſenteſt thou ſo heavily to ſupply what is wanting to the ſufferings of Chriſt? he for the glory of God would not only endure ſcourges and the croſs but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and preparation of mind he covered all
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:39021:111"/> the afflictions of all men, and this very anguiſh that now annoyes thee, which was wanting to his Paſſion, that is, to a moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire of greater ſufferance, and all tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment imaginable. Rejoyce that thou endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt this for Chriſt, who oughteſt to deem it an ineſtimable favour to receive one ſtripe that it might not be inflicted on him: but if thou brookſt this ſleight affliction, which was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his deſire, with patience, Chriſt will take content in it, and thou wilt afford him no ſmal comfort. O moſt loving IESVS, why am I afflicted in my tribulations, if I have this ſolace, that thou art ſolaced by them. Thou didſt ſeek, o Lord, ſome one who would condole with thee, &amp; couldſt find none: behold me here of my own accord, I wil be afflicted and ſorrow with thee, that I may be a companion of thy ſufferings and death. Who wilgrant me that I may die with thee, o Son of God? and if thou be pleaſd to ſend me only this light tribulation, why do I refuſe to be lightly afflicted for thee? others ſolace themſelves if only ſome men be joint-ſufferers with them; why ſhould not I ſolace my ſelf, if I be joint-ſufferer with my God. This is enough for me; neither do I covet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of men. I will grieve no more, o Lord, that I ſee my ſelf alone injured, my ſelf alone contemned; nay this ſhal be a comfort to me, that beſides the fellowſhip of my ſuffering IESVS I ſuffer all alone, and behold none of my brethren involved in the like diſtreſs.

                  </head>
                  <p>O Inſcrutable Wiſdome! what thanks can I render thee for communicating thy ſelf to me ſo ignorant by a holy and humble obſequiouſnes, which is the higheſt providence and knowledge of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:39021:112"/> man. It is proper to the divine wiſdome to be inerrable in all; and the obedient is alſo ſuch, while he humbly obeyes the commands of his ſuperiour. O how great and diſcreet a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is the obedience of the ſimple, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all with an indifferent eye! how great a bleſſing muſt it needs be amidſt the darknes which our paſſions induce, and the labyrinths of errour which our concupiſcence weaues, and the ignorances into which the depraved converſation of men and the cuſtomes and practiſes of the world lead us, to hold the right way, and be guided moſt ſecurely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of errour, no otherwiſe then if we were ſteerd by a heavenly conduct and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The invention of holy obedience effects this, which is the vice-gerent of the divine wiſdome, the profitableſt compendium of prudence. What greater ſigne of wiſdome can be imagind, then to be ſecure from errour in all his undertakings? prudence muſt lead the way to other vertues, and that is not acquired but with great difficulty: but ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is an eaſy-purchaſd prudence. The ſubject hath this preeminence above his ſuperiour, that he cannot err in his function. A ſuperiour in commanding may err and be faulty, but an inferiour in obeying cannot. Well may a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour command imprudently, but a ſubject in obeying cannot go againſt prudence, unles when that which is commanded is a manifeſt ſin: and in that caſe it were not ſo much a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as a temptation. A prelate may be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:39021:113"/> in commanding but not the obedient; becauſe in obeying he cannot but do the will of God. The obedient man is alwaies ſecure and aſſurd of the divine will: although what is enjoined be contrary to the will of God not approving ſuch an injunction, he nevertheles that obeyes works according to his wil and ſometimes much more meritoriouſly. A ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour may be naughty and command naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily: but becauſe it is alwaies in our power to obey wel, ſo long as no evil thing is impoſed, each ſuperiour is to be loved, yea and an evil one to be tolerated; there accrewing thence a twofold merit both of charity and patience. A ſubject may ſometimes perſwade himſelf that his own dictamens are more conducing to the good of his ſoul then the precepts of his ſuperiour; but for all that he muſt not omit to comply with his injunctions; for nothing can be more advantagious, then out of the motive of charity to relinquiſh and abandon his own wil and judgment.</p>
                  <p>There can be no ſafer conduct then that of obedience; and therfore ſhutting the eyes of our mind we muſt without reply do what is injoind, ſupplying by a prompt and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate wil, what our underſtanding is not bound to diſcuſs. Obedience is ſuch a welcome and rich commodity that no ſyllogiſtical diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are required to induce us to it. Obedience is a moſt evident inſpiration from God, and an unqueſtionable revelation, wherin one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt whether it be from God or no. If
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:39021:113"/> thou be heldſt an Angel approaching thee, and denuncing Gods wil concerning the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any good work, thou wouldſt not be ſlow in compliance with it though it were accompanied with great difficulties: thou muſt be more prompt in accompliſhing thy ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours commands, becauſe thou maiſt be more ſecure of Gods wil in what man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, then in what an Angel. And therfore a mans injunction being once made, there needs no great buſines of conſideration nor tergiverſation, but the greateſt praiſe is in a ſpeedy execution: but after the denounce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Angel, one ought to conſider who it is that treats with him, whether a ſpirit from God or the divel; whether what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands be good or the oppoſite better? one would take it for a great favour if in all his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions it were ſuggeſted to him by ſome Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin ſent from God what he were to do, this or that; &amp; it is no les profitable for us to obey God in man his ſubſtitute and our ſuperiour, he being as ſecure a domeſtick oracle, as if one were immediately inſpired by the H. Ghoſt. There are two primary cauſes of ſin, inconſideratenes of mind and depravednes of wil: obedience annuls both theſe; for the obedient ſubmits to anothers judgment, and by doing ſo not only ſupplies but exceeds the advantages of ſelf-conſideration &amp; prudence; &amp; that his wil may not be diſtort he regulates it by the wil of God, endeavouring confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in all his proceedings.</p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:39021:114"/>
                  <p> O what a comfort it is to one that loves thee, o IESVS, to operate not only to pleaſe thee, but becauſe it is pleaſing to thee! this is the prerogative of obedience, that ſo the obedient may not be fruſtrated of any part of the reward, which he expects not only from the work but which he finds in it; he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his end in the beginning which is to pleaſe God: and this depends not on any future thing, it being anticipated by obeying. O moſt welcome task of obedience! why do any complain or ſeek to be excuſed from it, for this reaſon, that if they obey with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and promptitude, more is enjoind them: for ſuperiours are wont to be more forward in commanding them that are moſt prompt in complying with their commands. It is a very fond complaint when we complain of what we ought to wiſh for. A king is thought to do one a favour if he commit any buſineſſes to his truſt; and the more and weightier they are, the greater is the favour eſteemd: if God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed after this manner with us, why do we complain? maſters for the moſt part employ thoſe ſervants about their commands who are moſt deare and intimate with them, and of whoſe fidelity they have good proof; &amp; why do we reſent that God treats us as ſuch? o God of my hart, if thou heldſt this favorable manner of proceeding with thy own Son in this world who was obedient even unto the death of the croſs, ſhal I dare preſume that any favour wil be ſhewed me of a higher ſtrain?
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:39021:114"/> o IESVS, thou who becameſt obedient in all, grant that I may never refuſe any compliance with obedience. Thou atchievedſt all by being obedient, from thy nativity to thy very death; thou wert no les ſubject to Caeſar and Pilate then to it. There was alſo a time when thou wouldſt ſubject thy ſelf to the powers of darknes, giving way to the divels, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thy ſelf with great obedience to the fury of hel in the executioners and malice of the Iewes: and becauſe thou couldſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Incarnate by it, thy Humanity being not as yet exiſtent: thy Mother ſupplied for this, ſhe conceiving thee by that rare act of obedience and ſubmiſſion of mind.</p>
                  <p>O moſt welcome task of obedience! ſince it is moſt certain that nothing is better or more grateful to God. Adam with drawing himſelf from it knew good and evil: obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is moſt innocent; it not only knowes not good and evil, but is alſo ignorant of good and better: for all the works of obedience are in the ſuperlative degree, that is, beſt; in compariſon of which the acts of other moral vertues carry no compariſon in this, that none of them is to be preferred before commands: for though one practiſe all the reſt, but yet do againſt obedience, they all avail nothing yea he does evil. But if he omit them for it, he ſhal have the merit of them all. The obedient man knowes no ſuch comparative diſcourſes, as, it is better to do this then that; but that it is beſt to do what is commanded. He that hath
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:39021:115"/> obedience hath all other vertues in a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious abridgment; he that is obedient wil be both chaſt and a lover of poverty. Adam after he became refractory felt preſently the ſtings of the fleſh and ſought a garment to conceal them; while he was obedient he was moſt chaſt and remained a Virgin; &amp; being content with his own nakednes, he ſtood in an exact po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. O moſt welcome obedience to him that is emulous of vertue, and makes God the ſole object of his love!</p>
                  <p>Comfort thy ſelf, o my ſoul, who coveteſt &amp; longeſt ſo much to ſee his face which the Angels love to contemplate, comfort thy ſelf in the interim and reverence thy ſuperiour, whoſoever he be, as an apparent Chriſt and viſible God: God is not worſhipped in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only, but in every ſuperiour alſo. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thy ſelf that the divine goodnes in its eternal love and providence hath ordained and decreed thee this Prelate, that by him and no other he might communicate his grace, and enrol thee one of the predeſtinate. Gods auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity reſides in him, enquire not why he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands this or that? Gods wil ſtands for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and ſo it muſt be in him who is here his vice-gerent. Why demandſt thou a reaſon for putting thy ſelf into the hands of God? Tell me, what was the reaſon he created not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, who perchance would have been better, when he created thee, and gave thee to thy ſelf? if thou canſt not aſſigne any, why demandeſt thou one for reſigning thy ſelf
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:39021:115"/> to God with all the latitude of thy will? it is an unſpeakable glory and content to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſpirits to be alwaies prayſing God; but it is far more conſiderable that it is a property inherent to him &amp; inbred, then if it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only from their mouth.</p>

                  <p>VVHy doſt thou contemne in thy own ſoul what men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſo much in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; they providing not only for lifes maintenance, but alſo for health and comelines. It would be held an unſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable miſery to be alwaies ſick, and a horrid deformity to have ones body compoſed of man and beaſt. Thou muſt not only ſtand in horrour of great ſins but alſo dread the very deſires and thoughts that are culpable, yea any imperfection. How unſeemly an object would it be, if a ſerpents mouth ſtood upon thy face? and yet every ſmal word whether but lightly detractive or offenſive or idle, is far more deformed. O truth, o immenſe goodnes! I beg of thee by the merits of Chriſt, that thou wilt remove this veile from before my eys, that I may throughly know how ſtupendious an evil is involved in the malice of the leaſt default! o man, how
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:39021:116"/> monſtrous a creature wouldſt thou ſeeme to the eyes of men, if thou ſhouldſt at any time appeare with the head of an oxe: or horſe in thy humane body! and yet it is far worſe if before God and his Angels thou conceive in thy ſoul deified by divine grace, diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and idle thoughts of terrene things, &amp; a brutiſh longing after thy own commodity: nay there is more proportion betwixt a mans body and that of a beaſt, which are in the ſame degree or order of things then there is betwixt grace and any ſin even the ſmalleſt. Wherfore the deformity of the leaſt venial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect exceeds all monſtruoſity and corporal miſhapednes whatſoever, not only what is now extant but alſo imaginable or poſſible. I beſeech thee, o zealot of Chriſt, by his moſt ſacred blood, pauſe here a while and ponder what I ſay with an unbiazd judgment: and thou who wouldſt not have the leaſt ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in thy body, permit not to thy utmoſt theſe monſters in thy ſoul the ſpouſe of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS. Employ all the faculties of thy mind, ſet all the inventivenes of thy imagination on work, and frame a deformity as ugly as thou canſt, &amp; ſuch a miſhapdnes as the very thought of it will fill thee with dread and horrour, &amp; this will be ſmall in compariſon of the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of a ſmall offence. The more excellent a thing is, the more we reſſent its corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and crookednes proves there the greateſt eye ſore where ſtraightnes is moſt requird: what more excellent then our minds and will
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:39021:116"/> which is in an eminent degree above any other creatures? wherfore its leaſt defect is very ugly, neither can underſtanding humane or Angelical penetrate to the ful the harme it cauſeth to a ſoul. What a prodigious thing would it be if thou carriedſt thy hart in thy belly and not in thy breaſt? it is a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy that a ſoul made to love God ſhould co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet pleaſures or deforme it ſelf with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance of gluttony or neglect in any other depraved affection.</p>
                  <p>Thou muſt have a horrour not onely of enormous ſins but alſo of all venial which are eſteemd little, material, and faſlely tearmd petty ones. That is not juſtly ſtild light and little, which only hath above it another which is great. A venial defect is not little, which hath only above it another greater, that is a mortal one: yea for this reaſon it is to be thought great, becauſe it hath above it but one evil which is greater. Men eſteem not only death evil and dread it as ſuch, but alſo a feaver or a deadly wound. That muſt needs be a vaſt evill which is only leſs then one evil: a vaſt evil which is greater then all others, wants, diſgraces, ſickneſſes, torments and hell it ſelf: it is a vaſt evil greater then which or equal God neither knowes nor can inflict, although he ſhould heap all the puniſhments of the damned upon thee.</p>
                  <p>Thou wouldſt think it unſupportable to have a canker which rotted and conſumed thy limbs: what if other diſeaſes much greater
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:39021:117"/> were added to this; leproſy, ſtoppage of breath, the palſey, dropſey, loathing of the ſtomack, the gout, blindnes, phrenſey, dumbnes, extinction of natural heat? One ſole venial ſin is more hurtful then all theſe. Venial ſin is a canker; it ſpreads inſenſibly even to death, inducing many others and at length a mortal, unles the depraved affection be cut off. It is a leproſy, debarring the ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by and loathſome ſoul of the embracements of her ſpouſe: it is a ſtoppage, cauſing diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing after heavenly things and admitting divine inſpirations, grieving and contriſtating the H. Ghoſt: it is a palſy retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nimble motions of our mind towards God and making us dul and ſtupidly inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the divine ſervice: it is a dropſy beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a thirſt &amp; high conceit of temporal things and a neglect of divine and wholſome ones: it is a loathſomnes of ſtomack cauſing averſion from ſpiritual affaires: it is a gout impeding us in the advancement of a vertuous progreſs: it is a blindnes making us dim-ſighted in the knowledg of truth, &amp; heavenly goods, veyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our eyes with fond worldly principles as if a thick miſt were caſt before them: it is a phrenſy, making the ſoul go out of her right wits; what greater phrenſy imaginable, then that he, whom the king to honour him, to have him his courtier, yea and adopt him for his Son had clad in royall purple, ſhould go dip it in a dirty pudle, and then ridiculouſly appear in his preſence? in like manner one
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:39021:117"/> that is veſted with divine grace and the purple of God, defiles himſelf with venial ſin, and though he be not ſtript of that pretious robe, yet he pittifully bedaubs and miſuſeth it; and dares in this pickle appear before the Angels, and come into the preſence of God. Venial ſin is alſo a deprivement of ſpeech rendring our praiers ſo ineffectual that we deſerve not to be heard nor obtain redreſs at the hands of heaven: it is a waſting conſumption diſabling the mind to reſiſt the divel: it is a decay of vital heat much diminiſhing the fervour of charity. Can that be little which is the cauſe and ſource of ſo great evils? how can a ſoul in this equipage deſire to repoſe in the boſome of her ſpous? ſtench of breath alone is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of divorce in order to marriage bed: how then dares ſhe that is ſtruck with a leproſy palſy, dropſy, ſhe that is miſerably bleer-eyd preſume to aſpire to a kiſs of her ſpouſes mouth? if we ſhould ſpoil our apparrel with ſpittle or dirt, yea though it were only wet with fair water, we would preſently put it of and lay it aſide refraining to appeare in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore company: how then can we have patience not with our apparrel but our ſelves who are naſty, ſordid, defild, diſeaſd, and yet even thus we covet the embracements of God, never thinking of being firſt cured or putting our ſelves in better array? if thou wouldſt be content on condition of being cured of any of the afore ſaid diſeaſes, ſuppoſe it were the canker alone, nay out of hopes of being
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:39021:118"/> cured, though with hazard, to have ſome limb cut of; how much more to be cured of them all? o the ſtupidity of man I who is ſo inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of ſo many maladies that befall his ſoul, and procures not, what in him lies, an eaſy and obvious remedy in order to a certain and invaluable recovery of its health from ſo many dangerous diſeaſes; ſince for the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain recovery of his body he ſpares neither limbs nor any kind of torment.</p>
                  <p>Go too, ſilly fool; be ſure in the firſt place to provide for thy ſoul; and uſe as much cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as thou canſt by avoiding venial ſins not to incur ſo many diſeaſes, and for that end be ſparing neither of care nor induſtry. Thou maiſt conjecture the greatnes of the malady by the difficulty of the cure. Behold what a medecine purgatory, which is the hoſpital of ſuch diſeaſd ſoules, applies to them: can it be little which muſt be cured with that fire and ſuch bitter torments? would one ſuſpect that fault little for which he ſees a nice and tender woman tormented in a flaming furnace for an houres ſpace, and that by the command of her moſt indulgent and affectionate ſpouſe? certainly either her ſpouſe might be thought ſome furious fellow or the fault was highly diſpleaſing. Why do we eſteem venial defects of ſmal concern, for which God who is ſo loving and merciful towards men, wil have ſoules ſo dear to him to lie daies and yeares in ſcorching flames without the leaſt reſentment of compaſsion? either God is very unjuſt and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:39021:118"/> cruelly bent, or the leaſt offence is a fearful irreverence &amp; vaſt ingratitude. Thou o Lord, art no tirant but an humble lover of ſoules, and thy mercy is above all thy works: this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y impudency too too enormous and ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious; which thou who art moſt juſt, moſt meek, and humble of hart, who wouldſt be glad to remit much of that pain, art forced to correct with ſo much ſeverity, leaſt thou prove defective in point of juſtice.</p>
                  <p>If one ſhould behold a dog ſtruggling in the midſt of flames and periſhing in a burning pile, he would be touched with a ſenſe of compaſsion; and how much more if he did ſee his own child in ſuch a calamity? o moſt mercyful Father, how can that venial fault be tearmed little, which it is unſeemly for thee to compaſsionate, though thou ſeeſt thy own children by grace, whome thou affecteſt ſo tenderly, ſo ſcorched and tortured in that pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culary fornace? and yet for them it was thou gaveſt thy life &amp; pretious blood. Neither pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal bowels repleniſhed with pitty nor infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdome was wanting in thee: thou art not an ignorant God who can be deceived in the eſtimate of a fault, nor a cruel one who takes content in puniſhing but againſt thy wil: wherfore if thou tormenteſt him ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly whome thou loveſt ſo tenderly, it muſt needs be a vaſt evil towards which mercy it ſelf is ſo unmerciful.</p>
                  <p>Let us imagin a man void of all knowledg of hel or purgatory, and beholding only by
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:39021:119"/> revelation the ſtate of ſome one ſoul pittifully afflicted by thoſe flames for a venial ſin, but wholly ignorant what might occaſion ſuch a puniſhment: what, I beſeech thee, would he gueſs to cauſe it? any ſmal or petty trifle or rather ſome huge exorbitancy which ſo benigne a God reſolved to chaſtize with ſo much rigour?</p>
                  <p>Again ſhal that be tearmed little which he in this life puniſheth with the greateſt of all puniſhments, death. If God cannot err in inflicting penalties, ſince he inflicts ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ones, how great muſt that needs be for which he inflicts them? behold for one venial ſin he puniſhed his own ſervants Moyſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Aaron with death: for one venial ſin alſo, as is probably thought, Oza and lots wife were ſuddainly ſtruck with the like diſaſter. For one venial ſin the Abbot Moyſes was deliverd over to the divel and for a ſpace poſſeſſed by him: and in very deed it were a les evil to have a thouſand legions of divels in ones body and be vext by them, then to have the leaſt venial ſin in his ſoul, and take complacence in it. The divel laboured tooth and nail for 40 yeares, together, to make a certain ſervant of God commit but one venial treſpaſs. Is the divel ſuch a fool that he would wait and lie in ambuſh ſo long to ſurprize him for a matter of ſmal moment? why ſhal not we be watchful at leaſt one day to avoid ſo great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief? o moſt pure truth purify my impure ſpirit from ſuch an evil; and illuminate me,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:39021:119"/> that I may not eſteem it light becauſe I regard it but lightly, ſince the divels themſelves take it ſo to hart; but let me eſteem that great which is done againſt a God ſo great; nor let me repute that contemptible and ſleight, which I a contemptible, ſleight, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant creature commit by ſinning upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and conſtantly; but therfore let me hold it great, becauſe I who am vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, dare do it againſt a God the beſt and greateſt.</p>
                  <p>How great muſt that needs be, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then we muſt but once commit delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, it is better to embrace a thouſand deaths, it is better that heaven and earth returned to their firſt nothing, and all mankind were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencd to damnation. If choiſe were given to the Virgin Mother while ſhe ſtands at the foot of the croſs, bewailing the torments and death of her beloved Son, whether ſhe would have him releaſed from theſe paines and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces, and behold him preſently ſeated at the right hand of his Father, and the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a thouſand worlds accompliſhed at that inſtant, or conſent to one ſole venial ſin; ſhe would chuſe not to do this latter, and would alſo perſwade me to do ſo too; nay rather then this, ſhe would chuſe to ſee her Son and the Son of God once more naild to the croſs, yet without any default at all, and if it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and lawful would ſtrike in the nailes with her own pious hand and ſacrifice him with greater charity then Abraham did his. Tel me
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:39021:120"/> I pray, would it be a ſlender courteſy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the Virgin &amp; her Ieſus if ſome one man were found who would put himſelf upon the mount Calvary in the room of Chriſt and be crucified and ſuffer in his ſteed? perſwade thy ſelf for all this that they would rather deſire a greater comfort at thy hands, which is, to eſchew all venial ſin. Conſider now whether that would be little which ſhould preponderate ſuch a piece of ſervice; nor do thou deny this ſolace to thy ſuffering Chriſt and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsionate Mother. Let us then cancel and aboliſh this opinion, that that evil can be light or little, which the Virgin, Chriſt, &amp; God his Father deem ſo great and puniſh ſo exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarly.</p>
                  <p>That is not little which hinders things orderd to a great and ſublime end; which leſſens the love of God in this life and delaies his viſion in the other. It is no ſmal rub which puts as it were a ſtop and let to the moſt ſpeedy and powerful mercy of God and his deſires. Would it be accounted a ſmal violence that ſhould ſuſpend a millſtone falling from heaven in the aire while it were poaſting to the earth its center? it is therfore no ſmal ſin which ſuſpends the divine munificence, and the ardent deſires of an enamoured ſoul, that they cannot reach their center God and the promiſd holy land of beatitude, but detaines it in the flames of purgatory. That is not a little diſpleaſing to God which hinders him from giving out of hand what he hath ſuch a
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:39021:120"/> mind to give, and we ſo willingly would receive. That is, not little which ſtops the current of Gods great favours and even in this life obſtructs the outlets of his profuſe libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. Let us tremble at ſuch an evil, and to the very utmoſt of our power uſe all poſsible diligence to avoid it; not enduring to brook the ſhame and diſgrace which the name of a fault imports.</p>
                  <p>How can that ſoul take complacence in the name of a ſervant or a child, or a ſpouſe, which is not carefull to pleaſe God and comply in all things with his ſacred will? how naughty a ſervant would he be thought, that would do nothing as he ought, unles his maſter threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning death ſtood over him with a drawn ſword; and can upon no other tearms neither by faire meanes nor foul be brought to his duty? how untoward a child who is allwaies croſsing his parent, and ſeeks to pleaſe him no further then meerly to keep himſelf from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited: for the reſt is wholly wrechles in accompliſhing his wil and deſire, and is lead in all with a ſpirit of contradiction? how diſloial a ſpouſe, who ſhould only ſo far forth ſhew her ſelf faithfull and loving to her fellow ſpouſe as not to provoke him to take her life; in other things perpetually croſſing and vexing him; and were ſhe never ſo often corrected, ſhewd no ſignes at all of amendment? what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of love would it be in a child or ſpouſe to ſay; I really love my parent or fellow ſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, but little regard notwithſtanding what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:39021:121"/> I put upon him beſides death or a deadly wound: I will uncontroulably do what I think good nor ever labour to humour him further, then may ſerve to ſave my life and ſecure my inheritance. Who could have patience with one that ſhould ſpeak thus &amp; do accordingly: Iuſt thus proceeds he who contemnes venial ſins and ſerves God meerly to avoid the death of his ſoul or forfeiture of heaven by a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Is there, think you, any maſter of a family to be found who would give houſe room to ſuch a ſervant or Son or ſpouſe? this is the prodigious patience of God, who tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates us even while we abuſe his toleration.</p>
                  <p>Let us then not miſprize theſe faults as little; which although they were ſo, yet are they many, and God is great and but one. Grains of ſand are ſmal, yet they may be ſo multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that they wil overwhelme one ſooner then a great ſtone. One locuſt is an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable creature, yet what greater deſtruction to the fields then their multitude? great citties are delugd by ſmal drops of raine. If we had ſo many little wounds or pricks in our body ſo many puſhes or bliſters in our face, ſo many rends or holes in our garment as we commit venial ſins, we ſhould be halfe dead, loathſome to the eye, and almoſt quite naked; and why do we ſuffer thoſe miſeries in our ſoul, but becauſe we are leſs reſſentive of its harmes then what concerns our body and apparrel. O how dare we appear before God ſo reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with confuſion! but why do I inſiſt
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:39021:121"/> upon the number? one ſole fault is to be dreaded, becauſe one cannot think any thing little who thinks God to be infinite; nor will he account it ſmal whoſe love is great: what love reſides in him who makes no reckning of diſpleaſing God? he that diſpleaſeth him in a little, really diſpleaſeth him; he that diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, tranſgreſſeth the lawes of an ardent love.</p>

                  <p>GOd is immenſly great; in his ſervice thou muſt eſteem nothing little: he were not great enough unles he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all littlenes. If thou loveſt him, true friendship is tried in the leaſt duties. Art ſhewes it ſelf in little things: the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vertue is no les polite, and therfore it ſtands not altogether upon ample ſubjects. Nature is moſt admirable in the leaſt things; it is moſt tender over the minuteſt creatures. Grace is no whit more dul, nor ought to be more backward. Thoſe things which ſeem more minute are to be more nighly regarded. Since God is ſo great nothing is little which eyther pleaſeth or diſpleaſeth him. In good &amp; evil there is no minutenes. Whatſoever is good, for that very reſpect is great: whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:39021:122"/> is bad, upon that very ſcore is not little. An infinite goodnes exacts by claime all our forces: he that owes all doth an injury if he deny any thing. Vſe not theſe manners of ſpeech; what makes matter for this; this imports but little, this is of no moment at all. Yea this which thou deemſt nothing is a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of great concern: becauſe what thou thinkeſt much or of great moment is nothing in compariſon of Gods greatnes and thy obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. O immenſe truth, how can any thing be thought little or great, if the meaſure of my obligation &amp; diligence be thy immenſity, where there is no little nor great, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of all meane. How can I ſay this is little, if whatſoever I do for thee is nothing.</p>
                  <p>It is not little which is held the leaſt, ſince perfection conſiſts in the leaſt. Little things are not to be ſleighted becauſe greater are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. If thou let a ſpark of fire fal into a pile of dry ſticks which thou keepſt under thy roof, a great flame will be raiſd which will conſume the whole edifice. Our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is as apt to take the infection of malice as a little dry flax to take flame. If thou ſleighteſt ſmal things by little and little thou wilt be perverted. Regard not the littlenes which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares at firſt, but by the beginning meaſure the end. Seeds are allwaies extreme little, and yet there is more vertue and efficacy in them then in any part of the whole plant. The part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of two high waies inſenſibly protracted into length ends at laſt in a great interval of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:39021:122"/> diſtance and may proceed to an infinitude though at firſt les then a ſtep would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the difference. If thou once ſwarve from thy good purpoſes and remit that vigour of mind, thou wilt by degrees find thy ſelf very remote from thy former fervour. Great things take their beginning from little; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a little is not the leaſt if it be but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. The beginning of every thing is its chief and principal part: yea it is not calld a part but the half of the whole.</p>
                  <p>Our H. Father S. Ignatius did with reaſon hold that it was more dangerous to contemne little things then greater: the dammage of theſe latter is more patent and may forthwith be remedied: but the prejudice we ſuſtain by the former is not perceived but by length of time, when being inveterated by cuſtome it is ſcarſe capable of redreſs. The very nature and enormity of ſin makes us abhor &amp; deteſt great ones; but little defects becauſe they ſeem little for this very reaſon are contemned; and this being ſo, our mind is not bent againſt them. Our concupiſcence is ſharpend and ſet on edge by little things, as thinking that it may wander in them without any great danger when it is not ſo venturous in great ones, it being curbed and kept in by the apprehenſion of a patent enſuing harm: but when our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is once enkindled &amp; a little traind up, how wil it then laſh forth, what wil it not encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? and for this reaſon we muſt ſometimes proceed with more warines and ſollicitude
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:39021:123"/> againſt ſmal defects then great. Cuſtome which, gaines preſcription upon vices, breeds from little things, not from great becauſe they are leſs frequent: nor ſhal we find it an eaſier task to reſiſt cuſtome then nature. One ſhal ſooner have an action in law againſt a publick invader and forcible ſeizure of our goods, then one that hath had them by long preſcription. Thoſe things which ſeem light take from us all remorſe and ſhame of committing them; &amp; that towards God being once caſt of what good can be expected from us? paſt ſhame paſt grace.</p>
                  <p>Be aſhamd to refrain from great things and yeald to little: for it is diſgraceful and a ſign of a coward to be foild by a dwarf or weak enemy. That little is not to be ſleighted in which great worth may be comprized. A pearl is not contemned by reaſon of its littlenes; nay for this reſpect it is valued the more as containing great worth in a little body: why doſt thou ſleight that little, wherin perchance thou maiſt do God a piece of better ſervice then in greater. Obſequiouſnes and diligence in ſmall things gaines greater eſteem: for as art commends it ſelf moſt when it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends great skill in a little compaſs, and we admire nature for compleating in each minute creature all the requiſites of life; ſo it is loves maſterpiece to beſtow its whole mind upon little things and ſhut up in them an ample and enflamed affection: and ſuch a diligence is much more praiſeworthy, the want of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:39021:123"/> being ſupplied by our affection; and that is it which adds worth and only is prizable. No true eſtimate of things is made but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ones affection: the leaſt ſervice is great when the affection is great; but that many times is greater in little things; and therfore an exactnes and compliance with our duty in them will not be les acceptable. Great things of their own nature ſtir up to attention, and are les troubleſome becauſe les contingent: ſmal things make les impreſsion upon the mind, nor awake it ſo throughly, and becauſe more frequent therfore more noiſome: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mind that is exact in them takes them more to hart, &amp; makes it her task to be more vigilant, more conſtant, and perſeverant in obeying. Wherfore he will be held no great zealer of Chriſt who zeales only great things: he will be eſteemd no great lover of God who hath relinquiſhed the world and himſelf in things of higher concernment, unles he alſo do it in minute. The perfection of a ſtatuary conſiſts not in unbarking a piece of wood or hewing it into great blocks, any rude hand can do this; but he only is a cunning artiſt who leaves not a ſuperfluouschip, who carues it to a complete ſhape, the leaſt bit not eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him unaccompliſhed. Any novice-painter can lay the firſt grounds or ſhadowes of a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet; but to bring it to perfection is the task of a skilfull hand and ſubtile pencil; and to conſummate ſuch a piece the leaſt limb muſt be elaborate: in like manner, Gods image in us is
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:39021:124"/> compleated by the leaſt duties of a vertuous compliance. That is no abſolute picture which hath only a head, belly, and feet; but in which all the parts are wrought to an exact proportion: why wilt thou preſent thy ſelf to God a rude and deformed image for want only of ſome petty trifle?</p>
                  <p>O infinite and moſt abſolute Lord, what can I deem little which cauſeth the leaſt ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude or diſsimilitude with or from thee? why ſhal I repute little what thou wiſheſt me to do or avoid? why ſhall omit the leaſt thing that may redound to thy majeſty or glory, &amp; not accompliſh all, ſince thou wert pleaſd to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all without exception for my vile un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthynes and ſin. O remiſs ſpirit, if an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from heaven ſhould come and tell thee that God for his greater glory, and in thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for all the benefits conferred by Chriſt upon mankind, would have thee ſuffer the torments of S. Laurence, how ungratefull wouldſt thou ſhew thy ſelf if perchance thou ſhouldſt ſleight the favour and make but ſmall reckning of it. Behold what wilt thou ſay? God exact not now of thee the girdiron or racks, or impriſonment, or other torments, but only that thou apply thy ſelf to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this petty action and do it not perfunctoriouſly: eſteem this a main buſines: the will of God is that thou do this, and it ſufficeth. Martyrs are eſteemd Saints for their patient ſufferance of great torments: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours acquire ſanctity by a patient ſhunning
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:39021:124"/> of little faults. The former tolerating great pain eſchewd the fault, the latter tolerating no faults eſchewd the paines of Purgatory much greater.</p>

                  <p>HE that loves to be prayſed loves an impoſsibility. Prayſe proclaimes one good; but for this very reaſon that thou wilt be praiſed thou art not only void of all good but full of great evill, to wit, a diabolical evil, pride and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. Although thou hearſt thy ſelf praiſed, not thou ſhalt be prayſed but another. Praiſe is only for the good; but thou art ſtark naught who coveteſt to be prayſed. He cannot be good or prayſe worthy who is ſo vain as to hunt after commendation. Wherfore he ceaſeth to be prayſe worthy who ſeeks to be prayſed; and if he be not prayſe worthy he is wholly uncapable of prayſe; for that will not be for the future, which could not be for the time precedent. If thou ſmileſt upon thy prayſer, thou doſt in reality applaud thy diſprayſer: becauſe thou art moſt unjuſt, whether thou thinkeſt thy ſelf juſt or no: for if thou holdſt thy ſelf not ſuch thou rejoyceſt at a lye: if thou holdſt thy ſelf juſt, this is unjuſt enough,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:39021:125"/> that thou be preferd before others who art nothing. When thou heareſt men ſay, thou art extreme juſt, extreme good; he that really is ſuch receiveth prayſe, not thou who ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art juſt nor good, and ſo to thee it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a diſpraiſe. The praiſe of the juſt is the diſpraiſe of the unjuſt. For this very reaſon he is unworthy of commendation and worthy of contempt for grieving at his being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and vilified, or vainly puffed up with ſelf eſteem: he that doth not hold himſelf contemptible pleads an excuſe for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners.</p>
                  <p>Self conceit is the daughter of a lye and Mother of ignorance, confuſion, ſhame &amp; danger: ſelf humility is the daughter of truth, and mother of merit and inſtruction: whether will be better to be confounded and deceived, or to merit and be inſtructed? love only to be praiſe worthy not praiſed, and this ſufficeth. Thou ſhalt only be praiſe worthy by ſeeking ſolely the praiſe and glory of God and thy own vilification. Why hadſt thou rather ſeem good then be ſo; ſince thou ceaſeſt to be good by labouring to ſeem ſuch and be vainly eſteemd: Why loveſt thou more to deceive and ſee others deceived then to frame a true eſtimate of thy ſelf. Why doſt thou vilify thy ſelf below a ſtone, thou procuring not only that it be of a ſparkling brightnes, but that it be not a counterfeyt; inſomuch that each one is aſhamed to wear for an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a ſpurious gem.</p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:39021:125"/>
                  <p> O moſt laudable truth, o glory of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with what face durſt I ſo much as once ſeek my own praiſe and credit, who have ſo often contemned thee? with what face do I ſeek to be eſteemd, who although I had been but once negligent in procuring thy greater glory, deſerve eternally to be vilified? how notoriouſly impudent or rather frantick would he ſhew himſelf, who ſhould covet to partake of the honour and credit he got, who diſhonoured thee by buffetting thee, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thee, blaſphemer, or mocking thee with a reed in the time of thy Paſſion. I am worſe then all theſe, and am convinced to be a lyar, if I prefer my ſelf before any of them: how then dare I ſo much as think of ſelf praiſe and eſteem? what madnes and wickednes is it to ſeek it; nay what impudence, o faint harted ſpirit, not to judg thy ſelf worthy of all diſgrace, nor wiſh to be contemned by all?</p>
                  <p>Thou ſhalt not therfore be really good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others ſtile or think thee ſuch. A ſick man is not cured by being ſaid to be cured. Which wouldſt thou rather chuſe, to be in very deed able and ſtrong in health although others did think thee infirme; or rather to be truly ſick and eſteemd by others ſound and robuſtious? Why doſt thou chuſe, to be held good, ſince thou are ſo very bad? yea it would be highly diſpleaſing to one that is ſick or in payn, even more then the malady it ſelf, if others ſhould ſay he did but counterfeyt, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:39021:126"/> loved to complain without cauſe? why takeſt thou complacence in being accounted upright when thou art the quite contrary? ſick peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſo far from deſiring to be thought ſound, if they be not ſo, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are wont now and then to aggravate the diſeaſe, and love that others do ſo too: ſo one that is truly humble exaggerates his own unworthines and is glad when others do the ſame, augmenting his contumelyes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces: therfore the concluſion is, he that ſeeks to be prayſed, ſeeks not only an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but ridiculous thing.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt commit a piece of injuſtice if thou be deſirous of prayſe and not of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, ſince a plurality of votes conclude thy contempt. If thou ballance thy ſelf, thy miſdemeanours and innumerable defects will preponderate thy good deeds they being very few and depending upon others. Wilt thou know in plain tearmes that it is impoſſible for thee to deſerve prayſe? it is impoſſible for thee to have any thing of thy ſelf for which to be eſteemed. And hence thou mayſt gather mans inſufficiency, for labouring to gain cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit by what is anothers: which if he had them of his own he would never glory in another mans right: as worldly men are wont to do for having brave horſes, faythful ſervants, or rich apparel, generoſity being onely the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the horſe, and a generous horſe may have a vicious or baſe minded owner. Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is the glory of a ſervant, and a good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:39021:126"/> may have a very naughty maſter. Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did apparrel is a commendation rather due to the tayler or weaver; and a fine coat may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a foul body and ulcerous conſcience. By the ſame vicious manner of proceeding men appropriate to themſelves what is only proper to God, even thoſe who have abandoned the world, while they do not wholly abandon themſelves.</p>

                  <p>IF thou deſireſt peace with God, humble thy ſelf beneath all men and all things. It is a terrible ſaying, God reſiſts the proud; neyther is that les terrible, the proud reſiſt God. God reſiſts the proud that they may not commit wickednes: the proud reſiſt God that he may not do good. God reſiſts the proud that they become not evill and wholly bad by their pride for which end he ſeeks to humble them: the proud reſiſt God, that he be not good and beneficial by ſtopping the current of the divine bleſſings: Make hence an evident conjecture that thou art extreme baſe, that is extreme proud, ſince thou reſiſteſt God; otherwiſe he would have enriched thee with innumerable benefits, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and vertues. It is palpable that a cloud
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:39021:127"/> hangs over thee which keeps off the ſun, if at midday in an open Champian his beames do not forcibly beat upon thee: thou wilt as then be all in the ſhade, although thou ſeeſt nothing that can overſhadow thee. None is more vile and defectuous then he who ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledgeth in himſelf no vilenes or defect, becauſe his mind raiſd above it ſelf ſtands in oppoſition with God and his clarity. There is no more evident ſign of our pride then the ſurceaſe of the divine beneficence; becauſe it puts a ſtop to Gods ardent deſire of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating himſelf; it impedes the efficacy of Chriſts Paſſion, the interceſſion of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and the prayers of Saints. Great is my malice and bottomles my miſery ſince I being but one can reſiſt ſo many, obſtructing as much as in me lyes the 5. Fountains of Chriſts blood, and the torrent of the divine libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Although we were ſo mad as not to acknowledg any ſin or defect in our ſelves, we ought to take this for a moſt pregnant token of extreme pride and baſenes; nor were our ſins inſufficient, ought any thing els to keep us more in humility; not the wormes in which we are to end, not the clay of which we are moulded; not the ordures with which while we live we are ſtuffed, not the miſeries of our body which inſult ſo over us, nor the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our mind which thwarts and fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes our counſels. It is more then enough to humble us beneath all things to ſee God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelf no more to us, and permit, as he doth our defects.</p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:39021:127"/>
                  <p> O humble Majeſty of God! how deare and deſirable is our humility to thee? Chriſt dyed for our ſins; but he permits them for our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation. Did the humility of man coſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then the life of God? Did IESVS prize our humility more then the benefit of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; ſince he carries himſelf permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely towards our ſins, for the cancelling wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſpent both his blood and his life, and humbled himſelf by deſcending from heaven, that he might give redreſs to our pride; and he that redeemd ſin by his own humiliation and death, makes ſins themſelves as it were the purchaſe of our humility? what is this which ſeems almoſt incredible, that God ſhould do incredible things to make us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? it ſeeming otherwiſe inconceptible that ever we can conceive thoughts of pride: for it is impoſsible to find what may ſource them.</p>
                  <p>We are nothing and we have nothing. Nay though we were ſome great matter, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nevertheles how we have behaved our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, I ſee not how we can with confidence lift our eyes up to heaven. We are in all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects moſt vile both for what we are and for what we are not; both for what we have done, and for what we have omitted; both for what God hath done for us and for what he hath not done in us. And becauſe he is ſo great, and we ſuch a nothing; who is there that conſidering the ſins which he hath committed, will not debaſe himſelf to the center of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility? And yet he muſt no les do it for the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:39021:128"/> treſpaſſes he hath not committed. For there is no ſhare of this ours, and leaſt of all is it to be attributed to us that we did not treſpaſs; and for as much as concerned us we had treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed. Vpon this account thou art as much obliged to God, with whoſe grace thou didſt not cooperate, and haſt equal cauſe to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy ſelf as if thou hadſt treſpaſſed. Things are not to be prized according to their actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity but their intrinſecal vertue. A ſword is not ſold dearer for having ſlain many, but becauſe it could and is fit for ſuch a piece of ſervice: thy malice was ſufficient for ſo many treſpaſses; that it did not actually compleat them, is not to be aſcribd to thee but God. Others offences ought alſo in good reaſon to humble thee as much as thy own: for although that thou didſt thus offend be not a thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thy reach; yet that thou didſt not ſhare in others tranſgreſsions is a peculiar favour from God above nature, and thou art pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly endebted to him upon this account: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is more remarkable that he preſerved thee from them, then if he had pardoned them being committed. Wherfore if thou be not guilty of puniſhment, at leaſt thou art of greater gratitude and humiliation. What ſins ſoever thou heareſt committed by others, deem thy ſelf forthwith guilty of them. The Virgin Mother had greater motives of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling her ſelf, for being preſerved from ſin, then Magdalen who had ſo many and ſuch enormous ones forgiven her, yea although
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:39021:128"/> ſhe were diſpoſſeſſed of 7. divels. Our wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſnes alſo in the omiſsion of many good deeds muſt in like manner humble us as wel as thoſe which we performed; for the firſt are totally ours, the ſecond Gods alone. No man can juſtly boaſt of what belongs wholly to another, but ought to be confounded at his own ingratitude, and double his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for the obligation. We moreover mar many good actions and do them after a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial and imperfect manner, beſides that they are both very inconſiderable and few.</p>
                  <p>But who is there that propoſing to himſelf what thou, o humble IESVS, didſt for our ſakes dare glory in his own good deeds? com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, o ungrateful Spirit, thy goodly and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous action for which thou art ſo vainly puffed up, with the infinite work of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, of the Euchariſt, and Paſsion: Wilt thou be able to ſhew thy face and not bluſh for ſhame? God who is all fulnes eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated himſelf for thee; and thou who art nothing holdſt thy ſelf ſome body in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, though all thou doſt for ſo loving and zealous a Lord be far from eyther fervour or zeal. If any one would bethink himſelf what God hath forborn to do on his behalf, would he not humble himſelf for his not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitating him into hell after his firſt ſin, as he did the delinquent Angels?</p>
                  <p>O man, the bain and infamy of creatures, what haſt thou of thy ſelf that is honorable, or why layeſt thou claim to any thing, and

                  <p>He that is not meanly conceited of his own actions both for number and worth is injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to God, eſteeming him only worthy of ſmal ſervices. Make God the pattern of thy humility, who after ſo many benefits heaped upon thee thinks he hath don nothing; beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf ſo towards thee, and rewarding thy merits which without him had bin none, as if he had contributed nothing to them: why then wilt thou aſcribe thy ſervices and good works to thy ſelf, as if they proceeded wholly from thee &amp; God had no hand in them, when nevertheles all is chiefly depending on him? why doſt thou alſo vaunt thy ſelf better then others, ſince thou ſhouldſt rather be contriſtated that they have leſs goodnes then they ought, and muſt recken their want thy loſs? neither is the charity nor clarity of God conſpicuous in thee if thou fixeſt thy eyes
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:39021:130"/> rather upon thy own perfections then thy nothing. Stars when they are in a remote di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the ſun, and partake not ſo fully of his light, one ſeems to exceed another, &amp; this is when they ſhine clearly: but all this proceeds from the darkſomenes of the night; for in the day-time though they more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the ſun as being in the ſame hemiſphere with him, and one then exceed another and ſhare more copiouſly of his light, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee which ſhines brighter, yea none of them all is expoſed to our view; they are then as if there were no ſtar in the firmament, but all a mere though pretty vacuity. He wanders as yet among his own imperfections, and cannot be cald an illuminated ſoul, on whom heaven derives its light but ſparingly. He that is in the night of ſelf love and ſelf ſeeking dares think himſelf ſome body, and much better then his neighbours: but Saints which adheer to God, though they be loaden and chargd with merits, prefer themſelves before none, but eſteem themſelves a meer nothing, fulfilling with their IESVS all juſtice, that is, all humility. The juſt man is humble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not admit, nor have any thing that is anothers fatherd upon himſelf. He that eſteems himſelf nothing how can he wrong his conſcience, by being unjuſt either to his neighbour as thinking himſelf better then him or againſt God as being highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of his own goodnes? for no body is good but God alone; and if none good cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly none better.</p>

The peacock though beautifull in his diſplayd train is ſoon quaild for the ſole deformity of his feet; thou being full of defects how dareſt thou wax proud for ſome one feignd vertue? remember that even from thy cradle thou art infamous for original ſin: as one that is branded with ignominy appears in an aſſembly of noble men, ſo muſt thou ſtand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the unſpotted Angels. Thy ſins have made thee a parricide of the Son of God and thy own brother IESVS: the wicked Cain was quite out of countenance, and doth thine become more brazen? account thy ſelf all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes his equal, and behold not thy moſt loving Father but with the eyes of fear and ſhame.</p>
                  <p>Thou who haſt contemned the word of God and his Son, why ſtandeſt thou ſo much upon the words of men? what makes thee ſo preſumptuous, ſince hitherto thou haſt done little or nothing, who when thou haſt done all, wilt ſtil be but an unprofitable ſervant? yea this title is too great and much above thy deſert, ſince thou haſt nothing where with to ſerve God, all being his already, &amp; he rather ſerving us. Thou art ſo wretched and needy, that thou neither haſt any thing nor canſt have: which if thou underſtandeſt aright, thou wilt at firſt be much contriſtated ſeing more clearly then the ſun thy own poverty, and deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be able to have any thing of thy own; but thou wilt ſoon be repleniſhd with unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:39021:131"/> joy, beholding the riches of God and how he poſſeſſeth all. I rejoyce, o Lord, that it is impoſsible for me to have any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſsible for thee not to have all. Why am I ſorry that nothing is mine, if it be in my power to make God mine? what an ineffable joy is it, that I can have nothing, no not ſo much as my ſelf, beſides God alone! a pregnant ſign wherof is, for that it is not lawfull for me to have any thing in fruition beſides him alone. I muſt only uſe the reſt of creatures and my ſelf as anothers, not enjoy them. He is not maſter of a thing to whome the uſe of it is granted only for a time, that is rather ſaid to be poſſeſſed which one may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy for all eternity. He that hath only the uſe of the world ſhal have the iſſues and profits of the Lord of the world.</p>
                  <p>I congratulate with my ſelf, o Lord, that I have nothing to offer in oblation to thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred majeſty: for what worth can accrue to things for being mine, to make them appeare in thy ſight? but becauſe I have of thine wherwith to offer, it wil have worth for being thine, &amp; on that account be acceptable. How can I have any thing of my ſelf who am noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? yea for this very reaſon that thou eſteemſt thy ſelf ſomething, o proud ſpirit, thou muſt repute thy ſelf more vile and abject. While a ſickman keeps his bed he perceives not ſo wel his own imbecillity; but when he is upon recovery and ſits up then he feels his own weaknes not being able to ſtand by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:39021:132"/> The more thou applieſt thy ſelf to the ſervice of God and advanceſt in the way of vertue, the more humble and circumſpect muſt thou be, &amp; then thou wilt diſcover thy own baſenes. While a ſickman keeps his bed he needs not fear falling; but when he riſes and begins to walk about, then conſcious of his own infirmity he truſts not to himſelf but miſtruſting a fall leanes upon another.</p>
                  <p>Why then doſt thou ſo magnify thy ſelf, ſince for this very reſpect that thou doſt ſo, thou art more debaſed. Thou art in a manner more ridiculous then Lucifer himſelf, ſince thou magnifieſt thy ſelf upon far les grounds. What is thy nature compared with that of the Cherubins? what is thy ſanctity in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſanctity of that grace wherwith the firſt Angel was enriched by God? what wouldſt thou ſeem to be and appear to others? thou canſt have nothing of thy own; and that which thou canſt leaſt of all have, is honour. All glory is only due to God, who though he impart other things to men yet it he will not. If thou doſt wel it is ſufficient that he knowes it, that he ſee and approve it who is to reward it, and whome thou intendeſt to pleaſe. Certainly if thou didſt love God fervently, and wert a faithful ſervant thou wouldſt wiſh, if it were not altogether impoſſible, to do ſomething for his ſake which he were not to remunerate nor to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of; making it thy ſole ayme to be loyal to him, never regarding the reward at all.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:39021:132"/> Among faithful friends one is careful of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other and does him good offices though he be wholly ignorant of them, yea many times he conceales them from him: for he aymes at no other ſalary beſides fidelity and obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiouſnes towards his friend: ſo he that loves God ſincerely, deſires no recompenſe more then to ſerve him and comply with his truſt. Let me, o Lord, imitate thy fidelity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me who am ſo perfidious, who doſt me ſo many good offices, who heapeſt ſo many benefits upon me wholly ignorant of them though thou knowſt that I am alwaies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful.

                  <p>IT wil be an act of pride in thee to eſteem thy ſelf duſt and aſhes ſince thou art nothing but impoſture and ſin. Thou haſt nothing good, why doſt thou ſtand in oppoſition with God? thou art repleniſhd with evils why doſt thou not bluſh even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men? thou art capable of having all evil; why art thou not in perpetual fear? thou art capable of doing all evil; why doſt thou not dread thy own condition? thy own very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is not thine but Gods: yea what thou hadſt before thy being was none of thine nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; thou hadſt then a mere nothing which had a poſsibility of being; and even that thou hadſt not of thy ſelf but from God; who if he were not, thou couldſt not be. Why reputeſt thou thy ſelf great ſince the very nothing which thou hadſt before thy creation was not of thy ſelf? Therfore thou oweſt more then thy ſelf to God; for this alſo is a part of thy debt that when thou waſt nothing he gave thee a poſsibility of being.</p>
                  <p>Thou receivedſt the benefit of creation: tell me what member was moulded by thy deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or to what joynt of any one fingar didſt apply clay, or afford materials wherof
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:39021:133"/> to frame it? or by what prayer didſt thou obtain of God to be created and calld out from among infinite natures and better indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals which ſleep ſtill in the duſt of their own nothing? what diligence of thine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented that thou wert not born blind, lame, frantick or ſome ſavage barbarian? doſt thou glory in thy talents of wit, handſomnes of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, noblenes of birth? yes thou mayſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do ſo, if God at thy ſuggeſtion made thee ſuch. But thou wilt ſay, I glory not in being created, but in being created ſuch a one, ſo induſtrious, ſo witty, and ſo toward of behaviour. Tel me, I pray, if thou didſt not adviſe God in the point of thy creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, couldſt thou adviſe him to create thee ſo witty, and after ſuch or ſuch a manner? if thou didſt not ſuggeſt to him to endow thee with ſuch a mind, why doſt thou boaſt of its piercing ſubtilty? didſt thou make choiſe of that mind, and cunningly ſift into that bottomles abyſs of things poſsible, extracting thence the beſt qualifyd? I do not, (wilt thou reply) brag of my natural endowments; but of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous practiſes I embrace while others ſleight them; I glory that I am better then they, an upright man, and one that fully complies with my duty. Nay be aſhamd that ſcarſe once thou complieſt with it, and haſt been neglective a thouſand times. O unjuſt and partiall ſharer! thou allotteſt to God the worſt ſhare; to him thou attributeſt thy being and clay meſt to thy ſelf thy being good: it is
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:39021:134"/> more to be good then only to be: Why doſt thou play the uſurper in the better half, ſince thou canſt challenge no intereſt not even in the worſt? there is a larger diſtance betwixt being good and being a man then there is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt a man and being nothing. God could make thee a man out of nothing only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, by acting, by living; but of a man to make thee good he was to ſerve, to ſuffer, to dye. Thou art a moſt unjuſt diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buter who aſcribeſt nature to God, and grace to thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>I never ſaw any body proud for his exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency, but almoſt all are for their being good and better; and yet the former arrogance is more excuſable: for thou hadſt had more (ſuppoſing thou hadſt any thing) by having a being when thou waſt not; then after it in being good and juſt: for we only not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to our creation; but we moreover put a let and obſtacle to our juſtification. O moſt patient truth of God! how canſt thou tolerate our lying arrogance, were it not for its ridiculouſnes; while we make our ſelves the authors of what we moſt oppoſe and ſeek by all meanes to deſtroy. If we carry our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves ſo modeſtly towards thoſe things which are left in their nothing as not to vaunt over them for our being: why are we ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently vain-glorious againſt God for our being good, and againſt men for our being better then they? why takeſt thou pride, o my ſoul, in that which ought to put thee
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:39021:134"/> moſt to confuſion? for thy being nothing thou haſt no reaſon to be confounded, it is enough thou be not proud; for that hath nothing of ignominy in it: but thy being an impediment to God by thy ſins, that affords matter enough to plunge thee in a deep ſea of ſhame and confuſion.</p>
                  <p>The ſelf-ſame that gave thee a being wil give thee a good being. As thou hadſt noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy ſelf towards thy exiſtence; ſo being created, thou hadſt nothing towards thy being good. If thou haſt nothing of thy ſelf and in thy ſelf towards nature, ſo neither hadſt thou towards grace. Yea although thou didſt nothing to deſerve a being, thou didſt no evil to deſerve a not being: but to be good thou didſt contribute nothing of thy own, and not to be good, thou didſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much evill.</p>
                  <p>Although humane nature had ſtill remaind in that integrity and dignity in which it was created, it would not preſerve it ſelf by it ſelf but by God: wherfore if it could not of it ſelf preſerve the grace which it received, how can it repair what it loſt, and glory in that reparation. Remember the infamy and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature after its fall by ſin: if when it ſtood intire and in a flouriſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it could do nothing of it ſelf, being now weakned and renderd contemptible what wil it be able to do? A pot glories not in the preſence of the potter of its forme and uſe fullnes though wel it may of its matter in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:39021:135"/> which he had no hand: thou haſt nothing at all before God wherof to glory, thou being moreover made of nothing; why then doſt thou glory of thy forme and uſefulnes, who mayſt wel be confounded at thy miſuſage; and canſt not glory in thy matter, becauſe thou proceedeſt from nothing. Thou haſt no ſource which can derive any goodnes into thee, becauſe of nothing nothing is made as by way of cauſality. If thou be nothing of thy ſelf, thou canſt do nothing nor operate any thing of thy ſelf, for operation followes the being. If thou be nothing of thy ſelf, if thou canſt do nothing nor operate of thy ſelf, how much les any thing thats good? if what is nothing of it ſelf have or can do nothing of it ſelf, then it is only powerful to ſin which is a defect and nothing, yea les and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible then nothing. The eye of it ſelf hath capacity to darknes and to exclude ſight or not to ſee; but in order to actual viſion it can do nothing without the aſsiſtance and concurrence of light.</p>
                  <p>That which is above nature and above thy ſelf, to wit, an abnegation of nature and thy ſelf, thou canſt not have immediately of thy ſelf and nature, but from God who is above both thee and nature. If thou believeſt not reaſon in this point believe faith: thou art nothing but impoſture and ſin: of thy ſelf is only thy perdition: we are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to think any thing of our ſelves as of our ſelves, but all our ſufficiency is from
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:39021:135"/> God. If we cannot ſo much as have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous thought, how ſhal we be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme meritorious actions? it may be born with that thou wouldſt ſeem fooliſh; but I cannot be perſwaded that thou wouldſt be held an heretique: why, I pray, doſt thou diſpiſe the world and conceive a love of things eternal? becauſe thou haſt experienced the inconſtancy of temporal things, and beheld unexpected calamities, as the death of wealthy and powerful men, and the like. Was it thou, or God, who combined things into ſuch a ſeries? didſt thou forecaſt the death of that king or Potentat which moved thee ſo feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly by beholding the inſtability of humane things? beſides, theſe ſelf-ſame things paſſed in publick and were known to others; why were not they as wel as thou ſtird up to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world? why when one is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed doth another ſtil perſiſt in his wicked courſes? thou muſt needs acknowledge ſome ſupernatural cauſe of this difference which neither is in us nor of us alone. Perchance thou glorieſt for thy being moved and not others; as if it proceeded wholly from thy ſelf. Tel me, I beſeech thee, how often have ſuch like caſualties, nay more forcible then this, happened, and yet thou felſt no ſuch motion? therfore that now it is effectual to thy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, proceeds not from thy ſelf but from ſome hidden and provident vertue, from his love and ſollicitude over thee, who would not have thee detaind any longer in an error, but
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:39021:136"/> excited thee ſweetly to an acknowledgment of the truth, and orderd things ſo, as he knew they would move thee efficaciouſly. Thou wilt reply, that therfore now and not before thou art moved, becauſe ſome hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friend of thine was abſent or dead, by whoſe company thou wert drawn to thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vererate and ſinful proceedings or becauſe a fit opportunity of committing them was not preſented. Wilt thou perchance acquieſce in this? was the death or abſence of thy wicked conſort or this opportunity in thy own hand? or was it not rather God who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed things ſo, and moreover furniſhed thee with vertuous company, that thou mightſt be incited by its imitation.</p>
                  <p>In like manner what good ſoever thou haſt or doſt, or what evil ſoever thou wanteſt and ſhunneſt, it is, becauſe God diſpoſing things for thy good removed all obſtacles, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably gave thee incitements to goodnes, &amp; moreover infuſed ſupernatural habits and helps to very many things which exceeded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the reach of nature. What ſhare haſt thou in theſe? if thou findſt none, what inſolency is it to aſcribe all to thy ſelf? eyther thou muſt acknowledg the grace of God and thy own nothing, or together with Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus confine God, and remove him from the government of the world, leaving him no part of providence. O moſt wiſe truth, take compaſſion upon me moſt ſenſeles, who am like to doat much more then that Philoſopher

                  <p>He that applauds himſelf only in the goods of nature denies that he is created by God; but he that glories in his talents of vertue, denies that the whole world and all creatures in it are made by him and diſpoſed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daind for our good: in the firſt he deprives God of the dominion of one only nature, to wit, his own; in the latter he deprives him of the dominion of the whole univerſe: in the firſt he robs him of his omnipotency, in the latter, of his wiſdome alſo and goodnes, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his fatherly providence had with due forecaſt orderd things ſo for our advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards ſalvation.

                  <head>The XIX. Chapter. <hi>That man muſt not only eſteem himſelf nothing, but alſo a great ſinner.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THOV art far ſhort of being truly humble if thou thinkeſt only that of thy ſelf thou haſt no good; thou muſt alſo hold thy ſelf very bad. Saint Paul ſtild himſelf the firſt of ſinners; and that mouth of the H. Ghoſt could not tell a lye: wilt thou perchance hold thy ſelf better then ſuch an Apoſtle, or think thou ſpeakeſt very modeſtly or with exaggeration, if thou call thy ſelf the ring leader of the wicked? eſteem thy ſelf in good earneſt the firſt among ſinners and the laſt among creatures, becauſe thou muſt prefer thy ſelf before none at all.

                     </gap>n thou, to incline Gods mercy towards thee; do not eſteem it an act of modeſty to think thus; for divine faith teacheth that no good at all preceded. Thou haſt no ground nor reaſon to think that any other who had experienced the like mercy and favors from God, that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:39021:137"/> thou haſt done, would have been les grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then thou art: neither is it lawful to judge ſo raſhly of another, who ſhouldſt hold it almoſt impoſsible, that greater ingratitude can be found any where, then thou evidently acknowledgeſt in thy ſelf. If thou wert truly compunct for thy ſins, thou wouldſt be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of this opinion. He that is tormented with an intenſe and ſtinging pain thinks no other ſo great as it, and that no body els ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſuch anguiſh: the affection, to wit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines and overwayes the judgement. If thou didſt bear any love to humility, thou wouldſt eaſily judg thy ſelf the worſt of all others. The proud man out of a deſire of being exalted prefers himſelf before all; as alſo becauſe he regards not ſo much in others their perfections as defects: thou if thou wert truly humble wouldſt account thy ſelf the worſt of all; thou wouldſt conſider thy own imperfections not anothers, fixing thy eye wholly and ſolely upon their vertues.</p>
                  <p>O majeſty of the ſupreme truth, what needs any interpretation? I conſeſs before thy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels before men &amp; malign ſpirits, without any tergiverſation, that I am the unworthyeſt of all creatures; the moral dignity of a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which grounds his chief praiſe, worth and vertue, conſiſts in the knowledg and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertence of his obligation, and his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to it; theſe in no body are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to greater abuſes then in me. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many vertuous men have been more
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:39021:138"/> illuminated, and ſome to the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance have for number outgone my ſins, but this juncture, to have ſind more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly and les cooperated with my obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſuch knowledg of them, ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of conſcience, ſuch inſpirations from heaven, all theſe concurr in no body beſides my ſelf. If any one perchance have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fewer ſins then I, he hath received alſo fewer inſpirations, and had les obligation: if any be found more calld upon &amp; favoured by God, he find les and correſponded more faithfully: but if perchance, which I can ſcarſe believe, ſome one may be found who ſind more heavily, &amp; had a profounder know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his duty; I do not for all this deem him worſe then me, becauſe ſuch a one wil not know nor reſſent ſuch obligations as I do: and although another had in very deed greater tyes, though I think it cannot be; yet acts of vertue are to be weighd by the conſcience they proceed from; and ſince I am perſwaded that my obligations to ſerve him are greater then all others and yet ſerve him les, I may wel be held the vileſt and ungratefulleſt of all. Although the ſins of Anti-chriſt exceed mine in number, yet his knowledg, light and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation wil not exceed mine: for he ſhal not obtain pardon of his treſpaſſes ſo often as I have done, nor wil he be urged with ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious and preſent benefits and inſpirations, nor preſerved from ſo many occaſions of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending: Although Lucifer had greater light
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:39021:138"/> communicated to him, yet he was damned but for one only ſin, nor had he ſo many tyes upon him as I: the Son of God became not man for his ſake, nor ſhed his pretious blood. Iudas alſo had fewer obligations from Chriſt then preſs me; for as then he had not felt the ſtings of death. O humble and meek im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of God, how canſt thou tolerate me, for not being confounded and ſwallowd up, in the gulph of my own baſenes! Let me not I beſeech the prefer my ſelf before any one, ſince I find no ground to ſuſpect any body worſe then my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Acts which render one ſinner greater then another, are but of a limitted number: how then am not I worſe then any of them, who can without any ſtint adde ſin to ſin; and have poyſon enough in me to infect the whol world? for after ſo many benefits received, after ſuch an exceſs of Gods love, ſo many divine inſpirations, I am ſtill extreme wicked: &amp; what if he by his grace in me &amp; others had not curbed the unbridlednes of my malice? I am daily by addition of new ſins more and more diſpoſed to deprave both my ſelf and others more perniciouſly. If one ſin of Adam was able to infect his whole innocent poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if one theft of Achan could render all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael liable to divine vengeance ſuch an infinite multitude as mine are what muſt they needs effect? I ſee not, o infirme ſpirit, how thou canſt chuſe but be confounded, conſidering thy own deſpicable meanenes together with
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:39021:139"/> the vaſt multitude of thy offences, if thou confronteſt theſe with Gods immenſity, with the exceſs of his benefits, the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible work of Chriſts redemption, with his ineffable love and loialty towards thee; in compariſon of which laſt, all the ſtupendious things he hath done for thee are little regarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; by which alone he was as it were forced to do what he did. But all this is nothing and much ſhort of truth whatſoever can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived concerning thy baſenes and infamy: yea eſteem it nothing; for thou wouldſt ſtill find thy ſelf more and more contemptible if thou wert but throughly enlightned by God. O moſt pretious truth, if the caſe ſtand thus with me, why do not I diſpiſe my ſelf, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daign my ſelf, abhorr my ſelf ſo far as not to know what either to do or think of my ſelf? I wonder that I endeavour not to reverence God more profoundly, I am amazed that I ſeek not my own contempt more fervently!</p>
                  <p>One ſole crime renders him that commits it infamous, even among ſinful men, who cannot penetrate the malice of ſin, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a worthy deteſtation of it. How then muſt ſo many defaults of mine, ſo many cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable neglects diſgrace and deforme me before the ſanctity of God, his pure Angels and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Saints. For although I may wel hope that many ſins through the mercy of God are forgiven me; what I was once of my ſelf I am allwayes, nor ſhal ever of my ſelf be more. If I had once of my ſelf, for what I might
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:39021:139"/> account my ſelf contemptible, why not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies? for of my ſelf I never have more: rather ſhame muſt increaſe in me, and how much the more I have received, ſo much ought I to humble my ſelf for my ſins paſt. Since I have learnd by experience the divine mercy, ſhame ought I ſay, to increaſe for having contemned ſo good a Lord, and ſtil perſiſting in my ingratitude. O moſt vile and wretched ſpirit, why in ſo great ingratitude doſt thou not deem thy ſelf unworthy of all grace? how dareſt thou be ſo bold as to beg any? why, if it were voluntarily given thee without thy demanding it, doſt thou not tremble ſo far as almoſt to doubt, whether it were not better to want that guift of God, then be expoſed again to a hazard of abuſing what thou haſt ſo often contemned? but hoping in thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, o Lord, I wil be bold and forward, yea importune to the whol court of heaven, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to it my baſenes and ulcers: neither will I ceaſe to cry to all and each Saint in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, till I be even troubleſome to them s &amp; at leaſt by my importunity, ſince I have no better title of my ſelf, I wil obtain greater grace &amp; mercy of my IESVS, that he deſert not me for deſerting it.</p>

                  <head>The XX. Chapter. <hi>VVhat it is to ſtile ones ſelf nothing and a great ſinner.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THou wilt abuſe others by tearming thy ſelf nothing and a great ſinner, if thou really thinkeſt not ſo: but thou wilt deceive thy ſelf if thou thinkeſt ſo, and proceedeſt not accordingly, treating &amp; demeaning thy ſelf as ſuch. What thinkeſt thou is it to be a nothing! to be no more ſollicitous over thy ſelf, that thou maiſt atchieve Gods greater glory, then thou art over thoſe things which are not touched at all nor moved for wholly relinquiſhing and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating themſelves. Wouldſt thou fret at him that ſhould beat the aire or chafe at another, who being placed in thoſe vacuities of the imaginary ſpaces ſhould ſpend his tongue and fiſts in chiding &amp; ſtriking that empty nothing. So thou, if thou eſteemſt thy ſelf alſo noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and haſt evacuated thy ſelf of thy ſelf, thou muſt not, as much as may be, reſent any injuries; otherwiſe by ſo doing thou wilt eſteem thy ſelf ſomething. It will be as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and childiſh for thee who tearmeſt thy ſelf nothing to ſeek thy own repute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as if thou ſhouldſt be extremely anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous how to wiſh honour &amp; proſperity enough
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:39021:140"/> to one that is not as yet created nor ever ſhal be. Wherfore thou muſt be no otherwiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards thee and thine, then if thou hadſt not as yet a being.</p>
                  <p>But by truly and ſeriouſly holding thy ſelf nothing, thou doſt wonderfully purify thy ſelf, and putteſt thy ſoul in a fit diſpoſition to receive without ſtop or let, the guifts of God &amp; God himſelf. Nature cannot endure a vacuity, nor can God ſuffer the humble man to remaine evacuated but he muſt forthwith repleniſh him. That God might become man he evacuated himſelf and that man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come God, one ſpirit with God, muſt not he do ſo too? it wil be an evacuation of thy ſelf, to eſteem and regard what concerns thee no otherwiſe then if thou wert a mere noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to let no thought which favours of thy ſelf or earthlines be predominant, to diveſt thy ſelf of all evil habits and affections, diſpoiling thy ſelf of thy ſelf, as much as if thou wert but newly created of nothing. God evacuated himſelf for thee, demeaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as if he had not been God, and procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſalvation in ſuch ſort as if thou alone wert to be ſaved: thou muſt take divine things, as much as lyes in thee, ſo to hart, as if thou wert God himſelf. Thou muſt eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate thy ſelf in the higheſt degree and recede from thy ſelf almoſt to an infinite diſtance, more then if thou wert not at all: which thou wilt compaſs, if thou becomeſt quite another creature by grace and love, paſſing from thy
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:39021:141"/> ſelf to God who is infinitly remote from nothing and all eſſence. There are two glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious prerogatives of the divine wil, love and power; but love ſeems in ſome ſort more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful then that very power which can, tis true, reduce thee to nothing, but cannot promiſcuouſly make thee another thing, nor the nature of a man the nature of an Angel; in which caſe thou wouldſt be more diſtant from thy ſelf then if thou didſt become noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but he that is beloved by God and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally loves him, that fire eating off the droſs of all ſelf-affection and humbling and annihilating his will, he becomes in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a God breathing nothing but the divine wil and pleaſure; for although he remain ſtill in his own eſſence, yet he remaines not in ſelf-affection, but is conforme to Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as far diſtant from himſelf as if he were another thing. One man feels not the ſmart of anothers wounds nor reſents the affronts that are put upon others: in like manner thou muſt not, as much as is poſſible, be reſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive at all of thy contempt for Gods glory, no more then if it concerned not thee but another.</p>
                  <p>Again, if thou reputeſt thy ſelf a great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, thou muſt conſequently perſwade thy ſelf that all the croſſes and calamities which befall even others are cauſed by thy defaults and negligences. What affliction ſoever God inflicts is for a puniſhment and redreſs of ſin, and in the courſe of this life he many times
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:39021:141"/> chaſtizeth the ſins of one upon another. Therfore ſince I am the greateſt of ſinners, they are my offences which occaſion all miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and being they are the effects of ſin, why of others and not them that are the moſt heynous? wars, plague, famine, are penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and remedies of my delinquencies, they are all to me both favors and puniſhments: in my behalf the divine mercy and juſtice are every where engaged; juſtice and peace give a mutual kiſs, mercy and truth embrace each other, that every where and in all I may o Lord, fear thee and love thee, be confounded in my maliciouſnes, and hope in thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. I wonder not at all that the world is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with ſo many calamities ſince it harbours me: I like another Ionas am the occaſion of this ſhipwrack and that tempeſt which invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves many, For one ſin of Achan the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent people of God was pittifully ſcourgd: I am a greater delinquent then he; why may not I preſume that many innocent people are for my ſake afflicted with general calamities. I, o Iſrael, am an anathematizd perſon in the midſt of thee; I alone ſuffice to prophane the whole world. I am ſo impudent that though I ſhare the deepeſt in ſin, I make the leaſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for my ſelf and others whom I behold groaning under ſuch miſeries, believing my ſelf to be the occaſion. I have wrongd all men by my ſins, I am a debter to all and guilty of all their puniſhments and humiliations.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THou muſt acknowledg great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to Gods glory; and it is but meet that thou be gratefull and a fervent zealer of its advancement: We are endebted to Gods glory for our eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, for our redemption, beatitude, and all the good we have. God wrought all for his own glory; and being he was ſo beneficial to us for its ſake, it is but reaſon that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate all our endeavours ſolely to it. O God of majeſty, thou ſeekeſt our honour upon all occaſions; is it not meet that man endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thine in all he can? Thou didſt honour man in his creation, making him thy own task above other creatures, and moulding him with thy own hands: nor didſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thy ſelf with creating him as thou didſt the heavens and other creatures by a word of command, but thou wouldſt as it were labour in it, being obſequious to him even before his being. Thou didſt honour man in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion thou madeſt for him, preparing him the magnificent pallace of this world, and ſubjecting all creatures to his beck, that he might uſe them as ſo many ſervants. Thou didſt honour man in his conſervation allotting
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:39021:142"/> him an Angel Guardian a moſt noble creature who ſees thee face to face, and ſtands in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual fruition of thy beatitude: and this thou didſt to honour us in all reſpects deputing for our cuſtody one adornd not onely with the endowments of nature and grace but alſo of glory. Thou didſt honour man in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, elevating humane nature to the fellowſhip of thy throne and majeſty. Thou didſt honour man in his remuneration, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for his light and momentary afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons no les ſalary then thy own kingdome, and preferment into thy family. Thou haſt through all a ſtudious regard to mans greater glory.</p>
                  <p>Let it confound thee, o ungrateful ſpirit, that thou ſeekſt not the greater glory of thy God. Procure his glory by thy own contempt: he will be ſo much the more exalted in thee, by how much the more thou art depreſſed. God &amp; man ſtand proportioned as doth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued and ſevered quantity. A number may be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gmented without end: a ſtick may be leſſend to an infinitude: the more a ſtick is diminiſhed by an ablation of its parts, the more the number is ſtil enhaunced: the meaner conceit thou haſt of thy ſelf the ſublimer wil be thy knowledg of God. Thy knowledg of God may be augmented without end: ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and the knowledg of thy unworthines may increaſe to an infinity, becauſe thou art infinitly deſpicable. Employ thy ſelf in pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thy own ignominy, and how thou art
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:39021:143"/> nothing but duſt and aſhes; ſo ſhalt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glory of God which was the end of thy creation. Thou wilt ſpend thy time much les profitably in other ſubtilties which rather hinder then further the knowledg of God. It is certainly known by a wonderfull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that a veſſel fild and ſtuffed with aſhes wil hold as much water as if it contained nothing at all; which notwithſtanding being taken up with other materials, is ſo much les capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that liquour for whoſe reception it was made. Knowledg of thy ſelf doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy knowledg of God; theſe two ſtand very well together, the one drinks in the other as aſhes do water. The beholding of thy own ignominy wil make thee ſeek the glory of God for which thou waſt created, and hinder thee from intrenching upon it. A tree at one and the ſame time ſpreads its root downward and its branches upward; ſo much it aſpires in hight as it gaines ground in depth: thy mind wil be elevated if thou keepſt it under. Wilt thou plainly know that praiſe and glory are not thy goods, nor any of thy appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances? conſider that praiſe ads nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal to thee nor ſuperads any perfection although thou be a beggar and imperfect: thou ſtandſt more need of a redreſs which wil rather better thee then only tearm thee ſuch, thou ſtill remaining wretched and needy. Praiſe then and glory are properly only found in him who is in no kind of indigency: for that very reſpect that praiſe availes him noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:39021:143"/> to whom it is exhibited, we conjecture that it ought to be beſtowd on him only who knows not what it is to want. Give glory to him to whom nothing is profitable, and that wil be moſt profitable to thee. God ſeeks thy advantage in all not his own; do thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire all glory to God, none to thy ſelf. As no creature is conducible to God, ſo no ſelf-honour is appetible to thee. Let all the glory of thy actions be intirely referred to God, as all the profit of his works redounds to thee. The glory of God &amp; benefit of man are ſiſters and mutually imbrace each other, God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders nothing to the amplification of his own glory, which makes not alſo for the benefit of man. God is not inconſiderate to put his hand to work he knowes not why: he is not vain to work unprofitably without any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; he is infinitly perfect immenſly good. By reaſon of his perfection he is indigent of nothing; and therfore it remaines only, that the end of his working be his own glory, and prayſe to be exhibited by creatures which is a thing altogether extrinſecal: by reaſon of his goodnes all he doth is beneficial, but becauſe he himſelf wants nothing, all the benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to creatures. As he can do nothing prejudicial to his own honour ſo neither doth he to thy profit. Thou being a man all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of imperfections and wickednes, thou muſt in nothing at all ayme at thy own credit. One muſt firſt be perfect in himſelf before he deſerve prayſe from another; exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:39021:144"/> glory is conſequent to interiour good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes accompliſhed in it ſelf: but by doing all to Gods honour thou ſhalt do all alſo to thy own advantage.</p>
                  <p>That only is advantagious to man which is glorious to God: if thou wilt ſeek thy own profit, ſeek not what is profitable to thee, but what is honorable to God: yea if thou wilt not be unprofitable both to the world and in the world, make Gods glory thy whole task and employment, that being the end of thy creation. As ſoon as man declined from this, he immediately became unprofitable. He is ſuperfluous and a ſupernumerary in the world who makes it not his buſines to advance the honour of God. All things take their profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablenes from their end: if they ſwerve from that they become unſerviceable. If thou takeſt a plain to warm thee withall, it wil not only be uſeles for that end, but thou alſo fooliſh: if thou takeſt fire to ſmooth a table, that which is ſerviceable above all other things, wil not only be unſerviceable but alſo pernicious; it wil burn and deſtroy what thou intendedſt to poliſh and perfect. All the uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils of arts take them beſides their proper ends and they are all diſproportioned and to no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: ſo man who conſecrates not himſelf to the glory of God, the end for which he was ordained, he is wholly uſeles and ſuperfluous. Thou expecteſt grapes from the vine thou haſt planted; thou covetteſt to reap ſome benefit from all thou haſt, why wilt thou thy ſelf
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:39021:144"/> only remain unprofitable? that fig tree which bore no fruit was accurſed, and ſo ſhal that man be that is unſerviceable. How great is thy madnes, o man, in not ſeeking Gods greater glory? greater then if thou ſhouldſt take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nothing can be imagined more diſſonant, more from the purpoſe, more abſurd, then to ſeek, I will not ſay, thy own credit but only thy profit if thou ſeekſt not together Gods greater glory by thy vertuous practiſes.</p>
                  <p>Propoſe to thy ſelf an end in thy manner of life, and underſtand it wel, that thou be not like a blind archer. Thou deſireſt to know the proper ends of all things that thou mayſt be able to uſe them in order to it; ſo, not to err in the uſe of thy ſelf have thy end alwayes before thy eyes. Thou undoeſt thy ſelf if thou endeavour any thing that makes not for Gods greater glory. Fix thy attention up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing els, prefix this as the ſcope and butt of all thy actions. Regard not whether they be painful or pleaſant, but whether they be acceptable and honorable to the divine majeſty. A ſick man that longs for health re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth not a potion becauſe it is bitter, nor takes a draught of cold water becauſe dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable, but he only reflects upon this, whether it be conducing to health: and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count accepts of what is unſavory and ſweet. Thou muſt be equally indifferent to all. When a traveller inquires the way, he accounts it
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:39021:145"/> all one whether he be directed to the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand or the left, ſo it lead to the place he goes to: he that playes at tables determines not to move this man rather then another, but only that by which he may win the game: ſo muſt we ſtand in the courſe of this life, inclined no more to health then ſicknes, to plenty then poverty, to the point of credit then to diſgrace. We muſt uſe the things of this world no further then they conduce to the glory of God; they are only meanes and are not to be uſed for themſelves. Embrace nothing which tends not to its end, although it be never ſo deſirable: refuſe nothing which makes for it though otherwiſe harſh, for that wil prove but too pernicious. All wil be vain and unprofitable which conduceth not to Gods greater glory. Can that be profitable to a tree which helpeth not to make it fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? what wil it avail if its leaves be guilded, its ſtock wrapt up in ſilk, its boughs hung ful of ſparkling diamonds? all theſe wil be to ſmal purpoſe and wholly unſerviceable; a little dung is of far more conſequence. All the treſures and riches of the world wil afford thee no commodity, unles they help to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, let all be as dung to me upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I may gain thee: let me eſteem this one thing in all, if I know them baſe in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of thee; if I ſeek thee alone in them &amp; in my ſelf.

                  <p>Commence each action with a reſolution to performe it, Chriſts grace aſſiſting thee more perfectly then ever hitherto, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Church militant to the glory of the Church triumphant, to the greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God; as if he expected no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from the creation of the world, from the redemption of man, from the goodly furniture of heaven where he is to be glorified by all the bleſſed, beſides this action of thine;

Be not ſparing then of a little labour with loſs of ſuch a commodity. God deſires that thou ſhouldſt performe this work moſt exactly; and if thou conſidereſt this his deſire, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf extremely perverſe if thou complieſt not with it, or dareſt reflect upon any annoyance of thy own.

                  <p>BE aſhamed, o lukewarm ſpirit to ſit ſtill upon the race when time and place requires thy running. Behold how puddles &amp; ſtanding pooles do putrify, and iron that lies uſeles becomes ruſty: go to; the way of ſpirit is like the eagarnes of racers; one muſt not lag, and how much les ſtand ſtill? how will one have leaſure to ſit, when he hath time neither to be weary nor ſo much as to fall. All indeed run, but one only wins the prize; run ſo as to reach the goale. If God had created all men at the ſame inſtant endowed with the uſe of reaſon, and equal in the enrichments of grace, and ſhewd to them all, on the one ſide the treaſures of heavens glory, and on the other the hideous torments of hell; and let them know by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation that one onely of all that number were to be ſaved, to wit, he who ſerved God with moſt fervour and diligence, who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the reſt in ſanctity and charity; and that all others were to be ſentenced to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: which of all theſe contemplating the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:39021:153"/> horrour &amp; terrour of that infernal pit, would not bend all his forces to excel his competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in ſanctity, and ſo eſcape thoſe dreadful puniſhments and obtain happines, becoming that one, who were to be ſaved? with how much zeale of ſerving God would each ones hart be repleniſhed? Every one ſtriving to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed others, none would be found who would not employ his whole endeavour to the end he might out do the reſt. There would be no place then for loyterers, tepidity would not dare to ſhew her head. But with how much more powerful incentives oughteſt thou to be inflamd to ſerve God with greater fervency then any ſaint hath hetherto ever been who trod the paths of this mortal life. The glory of God, and compliance with his holy wil ought in reaſon to be beyond all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon a ſtronger motive and more preſſing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment to the ſervice of God, then that incumbency of thy ſalvation. O eternal truth, why ſhould my profit move me more then thy wil? why ſhould ſelf love be more urgent then love of thee? it is a benefit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably greater, that many are entitled to heaven, and for this my obligations to thee are much hightned; why then art thou now, o infirme ſpirit ſo tepid and ſloathful? be mindful of the labours which Chriſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced for thy ſake; put before thy eyes ſo many youths who foreſtall thy victory, and tender Virgins who lead the way: behold the fervour of the ancient Fathers, the pennance;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:39021:154"/> humility, charity and torments of Martyrs: why art thou ſo lazy ſince thou haſt ſo many precedents?</p>
                  <p>Yea although thou aymedſt more at thy own commodity then the glory of God, yet it behooud thee not to ſlacken the raines ſo much to tepidity. Thou needſt not fear leaſt thy advantage be les, then if thy fervour were eminent above all others, and thou that one who were to be ſaved: nay it impots thee now to be more fervourous and more inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely bent upon Gods glory. No ſervices now are fruſtrated of their ſalary, and the better they are the greater glory wilt thou purchaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This would not be ſo in caſe one onely man were to be ſaved; ſince one might undergo great labours and reap no profit at all, neyther would a greater reward be correſponding to greater ſervices; which as then would run hazard of being null and ineffectuall though they were great, for this reſpect that they were not the greateſt: nay although thou didſt outrun a great many, almoſt all, if one alone outſtripd thee the prize would be loſt and all as good as nothing. Now our merits are at a greater certainty and more fruitful, now not the leaſt of our works periſheth, now all our ſervices are recompenſed according to the degree of their fervour. Why then ſhould we now be ſo pittifully ſluggiſh with certain forfeyture of a ſecure reward? what? if thou wert ascertaind that none at all ſhould be damned, but all partake of ſalvation, that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:39021:154"/> ought not to give thee a pretence of being negligent but rather highten thy fervour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a more ample enrichment of merits and increaſe of glory.</p>
                  <p>Go to, the ſufferings of this life are not condigne or commenſurate to the future glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: ſuffer not lazynes to reſide in thee, for it is the moth of merits and ſcab of vertues tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away all the grace of our actions, rendring them ſo light of weight, and diſtaſtful to God, that his ſtomack wil not diſgeſt them. If thou yealdſt thy ſelf to ſlouth, ſadnes wil not a little annoy thee, being forced to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the heat and burden of the day without any comfort the ſting of conſcience bereaving thee of that: but promptitude and alacrity wil make thee inſenſible of the incumbrances of this life, and is highly pleaſing and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable to God. What maſter of a family loves not to ſee his ſervants pleaſantly merry and going cheerfully about their work? If man love to behold a pleaſant countenance, ſo doth God a cheerful mind. Let not the ſad look of thy negligence contriſtate Almighty God, neither do thou ſuperadd to the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of this life the wormwood of ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: a ſluggard partakes neither of the joyes of God nor of this world. A tepid religious man in moſt things is in a worſe condition then a wordling. This, though he ſhare not of ſpiritual comfort, yet he doth of temporal, the tepid for the moſt part is deprived of both. He that is habituated in ſin is not
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:39021:155"/> without hope of being coverted and acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſanctity; but he that growes tepid after his converſion, hath forfeyted part of that confidence, there being greater hopes of a ſinner then of him. Great ſinners very often become great Saints; but it is a piece of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, if he that is tepid become ſuch a one. Experience teacheth us that it is more difficil for the lukewarme to become fervorous then for a ſinner to become a Saint: for a tepid man is far from reſenting his condition as evil; &amp; becauſe he deems himſelf ſecure, and that a mediocrity in vertue ſufficeth to ſalvation, he doth acquieſce in this: he muſt notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be wary and dread his ſecurity, for the danger is very eminent. But which is no mean ſubject of terrour, God cals &amp; makes enquiry after ſinners, Chriſt takes his refection with them; but as for the frigid they turn his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack and he loathingly vomits them out of his mouth. Shal I ſay ſomthing no les fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? the tepid obſtruct the current of Gods mercy, and ſuſpend the influences of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe liberality, while he is bountiful towards the greateſt ſinners; but towards the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent he is as it were ſparingly parcimonious, not communicating to them what he often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more willingly confers upon the other. I wil add ſomething yet more formidable, which ought to make each bone of our body ſhiver and quake. God who is ſtil giving to all, erecting every where trophees of his bounty, with the tepid he is on the taking
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:39021:155"/> hand, depriving them of thoſe talents which he had mercifully lent them before. What more noxious then to debar him, as much as in us lyes, from being beneficent? what worſe then not to ſuffer him to be good, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peding the activity of his goodnes and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence. Is not he accurſed who is the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch a curſe? how deſervedly then is he accurſed who doth the work of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligently!</p>
                  <p>Many things which are evil are at leaſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in ſome reſpect; but ſlouthfulnes is ſo naughtily naughty, that it is in no ſort conducible. What can be imagined worſe then heynous ſins? yet theſe many times through the wonderful wiſdome and goodnes of God who knowes how to extract good out of evil, conduce to our converſion and ſanctification, we ſeeking him after ſuch foul lapſes with greater fervour and humility. Slouthfulnes obſtructs all this; it is ſo hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully evil that it ſhewes it ſelf in part leſs good and proficuous then the very malice it ſelf of greater ſins, Slouthfulnes is the worm of time, it eats and ſpoiles the choiſeſt things we have, yea it is an enemy to eternity, leſſening life eternal by leſſening our merits, and it alſo waſts our temporal by its mortiferous idlenes. If thou demand whoſe life is ſhorter, I wil undoubtedly reply, that of the negligent, though he protract it to a hundred years: if thou ask whoſe is longer I wil anſwere that of the diligent, though he live but for a ſhort
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:39021:156"/> ſpace: death and ſlouthfulnes is equivalently the ſame thing. What marchant would ſit idle at home, if by one dayes paines he could compendiate the return of a thouſand years? do not thou ſet light by time; one day of fervour is more available then a million of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſnes and tepidity. A ſhort life ful of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous ardency is equivalent nay prevalent to a long one if it be cold and phlegmatique. If thou covet to live long, live diligently.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhameful is the ſhame of ſluggiſh idlenes? how ridiculouſly infamous would he be, who being picked out from among all the peers of the realm to fight a duel in his kings behalf, having before boaſted much of his valour ſhould now in the very liſts of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, where his ſoveraign and all his court ſtand ſpectatours, not have the courage to draw his ſword, nor move his arme to make a thruſt but bend all his forces to flight, leaving his adverſary an unbloody victory. O ſluggard, thou maintainſt Gods quarrel, many Angels beholding and enuying thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, who would take it for a great honor to ſuffer and combat for the glory of God as thou mayſt; this favour is done thee to be his champion: thou art become a theater or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle to God, the B. Virgin, his Saints and Angels: thou haſt often promiſed to behave thy ſelf valiantly, why art thou now, being come to the puſh, ſo daſtardly cowardiſh? o infamy of nature! do not defame the grace of God, nor fruſtrate thoſe ſupplies which are
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:39021:156"/> kept for a reſerve: why art thou ſo hartles in this work? conſider how fervently God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that thou performe it with fervour.</p>

We muſt prevent the ſun to thy benediction, and adore thee, o Lord, at the riſing of the ſame in the midſt of our ſleep, it being as yet night, when the pulſe of the bel or ſome inſpiration calls us to riſe, and behold, thou our ſpouſe comeſt and it is requiſite to go forth to meet thee.</p>
                  <p>To make this encounter fruitfully, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth not a little to prepare oyle over night, leaſt the lamp of thy love, o my ſoul, want fewel to feed its flame and thou like a fooliſh Virgin be ſhut out which is too terrible. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate what language ſhal deliver thy firſt
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:39021:157"/> ſalutes to thy ſpouſe, and what affaires thou art to negotiate in time of prayer: this being done if thou betake thy ſelf to reſt with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thou wilt riſe with cheerfulnes; if thou haſt a loathing of ſleep, thou wilt covet watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with much alacrity. How can a ſoul enamoured upon God chuſe but grieve that it muſt ceaſe to love him, prayſe him, improve its ſtock of merits, and that all advantages of increaſing his glory and its love towards ſo dear a ſpouſe, muſt be ſuſpended? how can it endure to ſee it ſelf ſuſtained by God loved by him, and regaled in this interim with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable benefits, and not to be able to relove him, or as much as be thankful for ſuch high favors. Wherfore it is requiſite both before and after ſleep, to make amends for that ſuſpenſion of love and merits with more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent affections and celeſtial deſires, ſupplying that loſs of life, wherin we cannot power out our whole harts upon God, and be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorpt in him. We muſt procure by this very ceſſation of merit and love, to merit as much, if it were in our power, as if we were awake. Vſurers even while they ſleep increaſe their mony; and thou wilt do the ſame if conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſelf to the diſpoſals of heaven with obedience and reſignation, thou make an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent oblation of thy ſelf, and beare with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience this miſery and the incident neceſſities of mans life. He that embraceth patiently a neceſſary death, whether it proceed naturally from ſome diſeaſe, or be violently cauſed by
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:39021:157"/> another man, he merits by it; and ſo ſhalt thou if it be harſh and noiſome to thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and ſleep, as it is to thoſe that ſerve &amp; love God fervently; if, I ſay, thou accept of this neceſſary burden with equanimity, it being wiſely ſo ordained by the author of all wiſdome. Perchance if thou conſider things in themſelves, and how much more burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſleep is then death to a true lover of God, thou maiſt merit by ſleeping patiently for his ſake, as by dying for patience. Merit reſides amidſt great patience, and patience is there greateſt, where greateſt aggrievances are born moſt patiently.</p>
                  <p>Among all the burdens of mans life and all the annoyances which beſiege it ſo cloſely, none is greater then that of ſleep or more worthily to be repented, ſin being excepted. Other calamities are only tormentours of life; ſleep for its interim bereaves us of it: other calamities are only oppoſite to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of life; ſleep for a time impugnes its ſubſtance: other calamities are in ſuch ſort noiſome to our temporal life that they exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly conduce to eternal by affording matter of merit, by rayſing our minds towards God, and drawing our affections as by an attractive quality; ſleep in it ſelf during its raign, is an enemy both to corporal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, for as much as it cauſeth a vacancy both from merit and all thought of heavenly things: other calamities are moſt welcome to Gods zealot, becauſe in them he doubles his
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:39021:158"/> ſpiritual advantages, love is put to the reſt, God is glorified; but ſleep hath nothing at all deſirable, a ceſſation both of loving and honouring God attending it, ſtep by ſtep: wherfore ſleep is more noiſome and for a two fold yea manifold reaſon more burdenſome then death it ſelf to one that is enamoured upon God. Death tyrannizeth only over the body; ſleep over both body and ſoul: ſleep on this behalf ſeems ſo much worſe then death, by how much the ſoul is better then the body; nay much more, to wit, as much as the whole man ſoul and body is better then the body alone: for death only deprives thee of thy body, but ſleep of thy ſoul alſo as wel as of it. Death aymes only at the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our body a thing frail and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſleep at the ſoul alſo, a thing eternal &amp; immortal which gives life to the body, it being wholly inſenſible but for it: death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroies a man, ſleep doth as much for a ſpace of time as annihilate him. Death is not to be dreaded, for it leaves the beſt part of man untouched, to wit, his ſoul which makes him a man by which he loves God and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends his mercy and goodnes, which is the glory of a man and ought to be his ſole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and joy; yea it leaves it more refined, without impediment, that it may honour &amp; love God more expeditly: ſleep overwhelmes and enters the nobleſt part of man, unſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, the ſoul it ſelf. Tel me, I pray, which wouldſt thou reſent moſt, to die or to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:39021:158"/> be annihilated? if thou give glory to God by dying becauſe ſuch is his B. wil; wilt thou not do the ſame, if thou covet upon the ſame motive to be annihilated? therfore if a patient acceptance of death be meritorious, ſo wil alſo a patient acceptance of ſleep, if thou reliſh it as an equal burden. If thou merit by embracing with patience the vexatious incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of this life, why ſhalt thou not alſo merit by ſleep if it be the greateſt incumbrance of all, yea it being the ſole and only thing which living and dying we muſt deem cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: for neither in this life nor after death is there any thing, ſin being ſet aſide, more burdenſome to one that is feelingly devoted to the ſervice of God. What are accounted the burdens which preſs ſo heavily upon this life, but its ſufferings and miſeries? but one ſhould be ſo far from eſteeming ſufferance a burden that it ought to be the ſcope and but of his deſires: next after God there is noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more expetible then to ſuffer for God, exhibiting this as the credentials of our love: for by ſo doing we perfect the knot of true charity being more ſtraitly united to him, we dilate the confined raies of his glory, and merit to be partakers of the ſame. No body knowes throughly how burdenſome ſleep is to us beſides him who is able to make a true eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the immenſity of Gods glory, the invaluablenes of his love, and the leaſt degree of grace, in order to all which for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim there is a dead ſurceaſe, &amp; a ſuſpenſion
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:39021:159"/> of all traffique for new merits. After the cloze of this life what is noiſome to the juſt beſides purgatory; but if thou be then in a condition of ſuffering it ought not to be reſentive at all, thou being therby refined and purified, thy ſpouſe trimming thee up in ſuch a dreſs as may wel beſeem his bedchamber. If he leave it then wholly in thy power to love God, what cauſe of tergiverſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſince he leaves arbitrary to thee what thou wiſheſt and deſireſt? where thou haſt opportunity to ſuffer and love, there is no juſt ground of complaint. If it were put to thy choiſe whether thou wouldſt ſleep or die for half an houres ſpace; a ſoul truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the ardours of charity, would of it ſelf prefer death that it might not be reduced to a ceſſation of love: yea it would not, thirſt more after the reſurrection of the body then after avoiding all unneceſſary exceſs of ſleep though but for a quarter of an hour, as much as might be without impairing its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral health. For the mean of diſcretion is every where to be obſerved, and we muſt take a neceſſary repoſe though againſt our will that the functions of our mind may be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and maſculine, fitly diſpoſed for all enterprizes to Gods glory, as alſo for praier: leaſt if we indiſcreetly deprive our ſelves of it, we be heavy at our devotions, too drowzy and languiſhing, and ſo by little and little quite benumd; and what then wil be the iſſue, but that we perform them with little fruit. But to be too indulgent to ſleep beſeems
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:39021:159"/> the dead rather then the living; and a ſoul weighing things in themſelves, that is, with an impartial ballance, and ſiezd with the heat of divine love, to avoid this inconvenience, all acts of love and prayſe ſurceaſing for that interim, it would perchance rather make choiſe of a perpetual death of the body; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in that caſe one may love &amp; enjoy God, which alone ſufficeth and is the chief deſire of an enamoured ſoul but being ſo charmed and ſtupifyd it cannot: although one wil not eaſily conceive this who doth not experience in himſelf the avaricious incentives of divine love and its reſtles longings and motions, nor how contemptibly an enflamd hart ſpurns at all ſelf commodity. But we muſt not meaſure the ardour of true love and a devoted affection by the ell of our lukewarmnes: rather by what we behold in thoſe that fondly doat even to madnes upon a periſhable beauty, we may gueſs at the feelings and flames of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender to an eternal and never fading one. But if thy breaſt harbour not fuel for ſuch a heat, ſhun at leaſt as much as thou canſt the chilnes of tepidity and ſleepines.</p>
                  <p>If it were intimated to thee that forthwith thou muſt be annihilated; ſuch tydings would fil thee with horrour why then wilt thou ſo joy in ſleep, it being all one as if for ſuch a reſpit thou wert annihilated. Apprehend the incommodities of ſleep which is an evil &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold death, it being very oppoſite to a 4. fold life; for ſleep deprives us of the chief life of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:39021:160"/> our body, in which it is equivalent to death it ſelf: it takes away the life of our ſoul, which is then as if it were not at all, &amp; in this it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth death: ſleep is alſo in ſome ſort inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the life of grace, and the eternal life, by cauſing ſuch an interruption of merit. What then can be more prejudicial to us? wherfore one that burnes with the true flame of divine love, and is ſiezd with an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of prayſing ſo great a good, is hugely covetous of the leaſt advantages of time, and deems any unneceſſary expenſe in that kind an irreparable loſs: and conſequently he goes to ſleep with much regret, accepting with patience this neceſſity impoſed by God upon life and making to him an oblation of it; taking in good part, ſince his holy wil is ſuch, to be deprived for this interim of what he much more covets, which is to love &amp; prayſe God and be reſtles in his ſervice; and as much as in him lyes he covets not to ſleep but rather buſy himſelf in the former actuations, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every hour a day til he return to his wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed employment. Thou alſo muſt put on this diſpoſition of wil and offer it to God &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thy ſelf like one ready to give up the Ghoſt ſaying with Chriſt, into thy hands o Lord I commend my ſpirit. By thus behaving thy ſelf thou ſhalt after a manner merit by that death and vacancy of ſleep ſo untoothſome and diſtaſtful to thy relliſh.</p>
                  <p>Conceive alſo ardent deſires of that ever during life, when without interruption thou
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:39021:160"/> ſhalt enjoy God, and bewail the miſeries of this life, ſince thou muſt ſeek repoſe and relaxation for thy exhauſted ſpirits in a thing of all others moſt burdenſome to thee and prejudicial to all, to wit, ſleep. How can life it ſelf chuſe but be noyſome, its very reſt being ſo reſtles, and its advantages ſo diſadvantageous? it is a lamentable thing, that life muſt be repaird at the very charges and expenſes of life, ſince the lover of God eſteems ſomtimes a ſhort ſleep more damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable then the loſs of a long life. When thou art laid to repoſe, endeavour to ſeal up thy eyes and hart with the ferventeſt act of love which ever thou didſt make in thy whole life, and even before thou falleſt a ſleep deſire to riſe as ſoon as may be, purpoſing at thy firſt waking to unſeale thy hart and actuate it in more fervent e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It wil not a little conduce to this to beg the concurrence of thy Angel Guardian as alſo to uſe a ſpare and frugal diet. Strike up this bargain with thy body; in the meane while repoſe, take thy penny-worths, but be ſure to riſe as ſoon as the bell calls thee to work. Like as the ſoul for the good of the body dies as it were by night and is buried, ſo muſt the body die by day for the good and benefit of the ſoul: while it is awake let the body be dead to this world as when the ſoul is a ſleep it is dead for that reſpit to heaven, that is, to meritorious actions and pious

The ſole ſuſpition of a batail armes a ſouldier and makes him continue ſo for many dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he expects to fight one day; what ought the certainty and belief of a daily conflict to operate in us? diſpoſe all thy actions in the morning, and depoſe them in the hands of God; and purpoſe to be twice as good to day as thou waſt yeſterday, leaſt in the day time the divel interpoſe himſelf, and prevail

Fight ſtoutly all day long and at night expect to die. The life of man is a warfare in which life is allwaies hazardous and labour certain. As often as thou art but a little foild fight more eagerly; and perſwade thy ſelf that ſuch foiles wil be frequent, for the juſt man is foild 7. times a day: but riſe forth with with redoubled courage. as a ſouldier who having received a wound flies more keenly at his adverſary. Where thou perceiveſt any breach make it up incontinently, and fortify it more ſtrongly by calling a ſquadron of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to thy aſſiſtance which muſt be at hand like a valorous and approved reſerve, muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thy morning meditation, repentance and humility leading them up. And delay not to repair that negligence, for otherwiſe thy vigour of ſpirit wil eaſily ſlacken. He that receives but a ſleight wound will faint unles he ſtop the effuſion of blood; and by delay that which is otherwiſe but an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable hurt wil become mortal.

                  <p>Yet for all this be not ſo contriſtated for any ſmal defect as that it ſmel rather of pride then repentance, and thou be hinderd thereby from performing thy other exerciſes which require a great deal of alacrity. B. Aloyſius Gonzaga had reaſon to ſay, that thoſe who were too anxious over their ſmal defects did not ſufficiently know themſelves. Thou art all miſery, but thou hopeſt one day to be happy. be les contriſtated and more humble. If thou acknowledg thy miſery a fixt hope in almighty God will leſſen thy anxiety; and diſpair of any good will increaſe humility in thee. Many are therfore dejected becauſe they grieve not ſo much for having offended God as for their own infirmity and vilenes, while they find themſelves ſo impotent and faint harted; and becauſe this affection naturally ſympathizeth with ſelf love it is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and ſometimes occaſioneth no ſmal harm. Grieve only for having offended God; but rejoice forth with by a confidence in IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS: and congratulate with thy ſelf for thy
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:39021:169"/> own vilenes; for thou art nothing of thy ſelf but only by God, which is much better for thee. By this meanes the defect it ſelf wil more animate thee, and render thee more confident by putting thy truſt in God, ſince thou doſt actually experience and as it were by groping palpably perceive, that by thy own ſtrength thou canſt do nothing, but only by God and with God, on whom thou maiſt much more ſecurely rely: for he is far greater in goodnes then thy good will can be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</p>
                  <p>Perſwade thy ſelf that perchance each hour thou wilt faulter a hundred times; but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Gods grace aſſiſting thee, to riſe again a thouſand. By how much more frequent thy lapſes are, riſe ſo much more confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art more conſcious of thy own inſufficiency. Then is our hope more purely and ſincerely fixt in God when we diſpair to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally of our ſelves; and then experience it ſelf will teach us this when we ſee our ſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end to fail in our good purpoſes: God permits that becauſe we do not ſufficiently humble our ſelves. If thou wert truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thou wouldſt redreſs many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſpeak nothing but victories Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy ſelf in the preſence of God; miſtruſt thy ſelf and truſt in him; and being armed with this, live this day with much circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, diligence, and deſire, as if the whole multitude of men were created this day, and of all that world one only were to

Mans hart is the conſecrated altar of God and the throne of the H. Ghoſt. Thou muſt preſerve it with all ſollicitude, that it may be free from this world &amp; not defiled with the images of terrene &amp; impertinent things, with which the world and the divel by the windows of thy ſenſes batter thee as with ſo many engins. Thou muſt be more careful of thy hart then of an altar, an Oratory, and conſecrated chalices, where we offer ſacrifice, worſhip, and keep the very Body of Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. With how much diligence, and under how many locks do uſurers keep their
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:39021:170"/> mony and the inſtruments of death? with how much nicenes do thoſe that delight in rarities keep any choiſe jewel, or forraign no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yelty, making preſently a cabinet for it that the leaſt grain of duſt may not tarniſh it? &amp; canſt thou think that the gemm of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and the H. Ghoſt can be preſerved with requiſite decency, without an exquiſite care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes? If thou didſt carry the moſt H. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt in thy hands, how ſollicitous wouldſt thou be not to let it fal; and if thou carry God in thy hart, why wilt thou be leſs attentive? The hart is a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate member any little offence to it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream prejudicial, any trifling wound is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the body: and in like manner any negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the cuſtody of our hart doth much prejudice the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>The kingdom of God is within us: why do we beg miſeries abroad by our ſenſes? an unblemiſhd hart is the oracle of God: he ſpeaks within us: how can we harken attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely if we be gazing and wandering abroad? while thou converſeſt with one thou giveſt not eare to another that interrupts thee: how canſt thou hear God, being diſtracted with ſo many affaires? Why doſt thou deſire to gaze abroad upon any beautiful object, to tickle thy eares with pleaſing ſounds, to feed thy fancy with forraign newes, ſince thou haſt God within thee in whom all beauty is comprizd, all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure reſides as in in its center, and a perpetual newnes is diſcoverable even to the B. Angels
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:39021:171"/> themſelves, though they be in a perpetual fruition even from the very infancy and nona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of the world? they beheld him before the prevarication of Adam and ſtil he is new to their eyes. Which of the bleſſed would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh the viſion and converſation of God, and ſeparate from him to behold any curioſity upon earth, or who, that is placed but at the gates of heaven, would for that end re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede thence? o how much alſo is he to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed, who in expectation of this earthly trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, hinders his progreſs in ſpirit, forſaking the portal of heaven, which is a wel guarded hart; leaves God alone, and ſometimes his own hart too, expelling God from it, in ſuch ſort that he can neither know him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly, nor hear him expeditly that thou mayſt be able to contemplate thy ſelf in a myrrour thou firſt of all wipeſt off the duſt: how canſt thou hope to ſee God in thy hart, if thou daube it over with the clay of terrene affections?</p>
                  <p>If one ſhould tel thee that S. Paul the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle newly come from the third heaven, were in the ſtreets explaining and unfolding hidden myſteries, thou wouldſt leave all though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo pleaſing and profitable, &amp; wouldſt run with much ſpeed, though far diſtant to hear &amp; ſee him. Behold thou needſt not go one ſtep to hear God inculcating things ſalutiferous, and teaching hidden ſecrets while he comes to thee and ſejourns with thee: why doſt thou not leave theſe exteriour things ſo fruitleſly
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:39021:171"/> burdenſome, overcoming all itch of novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and vain curioſities, by which thy fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour doth ſo evaporate? this ought to be ſo highly prizd that the ſervant of God F. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Villanova was wont to ſay, that although it were told him that an Angel were come from heaven and ſtood in the market place diſcloſing wonderful and ſtupendious myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and that great concourſe were made thither, he would not ſtir one foot, only to overcome curioſity. And certainly it were much better not to ſee an Angel, then to be overcome by it, if that were the only motive of ſeing him. What retaineſt thou now of all the vanities thou haſt beheld beſides ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments perchance of contemplating God, thy mind being burdend with vain fancies and images of things both falſe and frivolous. The les thou ſeeſt the more thou leſſeneſt thy deſire and occaſions of errour. A hart ſhut up to the world is the open gate of truth, which gate is ſhut by giving free ſcope to our exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſenſes: they are theſe material things that ſhut it: Wherfore thou muſt alwayes keep within at home and not go forth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns but with leave from God, and for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and his glory. Then they wil cauſe no hindrance: but forthwith as ſoon as ever thou haſt done thy buſines retire home again, reſaluting and ſpeaking to God who is there expecting thee: yea recolect thy ſelf now and then privily in the very diſpatch it ſelf: ſteal thy ſelf from thy employments, and put thy
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:39021:172"/> ſelf in the preſence of God. Whatſoever thou art to enterprize weigh it wel before hand, &amp; offer it up to God, and as much as thou canſt have perpetual recourſe to him: viſit him in thy hart, ask his advice, and implore with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility his favorable aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>But the chief gate which man muſt ſet a guard upon, is his mouth leaſt its words prove the outlet of devotion. O how often do many ſel God at a lower rate then did Iudas, ſince they ſell him for one word! Simon Magus was caſhierd for covetting to buy the H. Ghoſt with mony: others looſe him not for mony but a little breath and ayre of their mouth. O moſt holy ſpirit, who utterſt nothing but Oracles of truth, how can I relinquiſh thee to attend to the forgeries of men, or my ſelf to ſpeak vanities: conduct me with my IESVS into the deſert of my hart, that there thou mayſt inſtruct, illuminate, and ſtreng then me to beare thy croſs. O God, o Chriſt of my hart, grant me grace to follow thee out of the world and worldly crowds, that I may dye with thee out of the city. Thou, chargd with thy heavy croſs, didſt walk out of Ieruſalem to dye for me, and accompliſh my ſalvation in the ſolitude: inſtructing me how I am to go out of this world and ſeek thee in my ſelf and bear thy croſs and be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the world in the ſolitude of my hart. I wiſh my life could be ſayd to be like a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare upon earth! a ſouldier forſakes parents, allyes, friends, country, commodities, and

                     </q> as ſaith S. Proſper. The greateſt grace of all other is to preſerve the grace which is given thee, and thy chief work not to ſurceaſe from doing works. As a creature would be very deformed without head and life, ſuch a monſter is a good life without a correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing end. We have received grace without any paines, but we muſt conſerve it both by grace and paines. The beginning of a thing is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted half its accompliſhment; but unles it end wel all comes to nothing. In the matter of perſeverance the end is all in all: for noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is done ſo long as any thing remaines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. It imports little to have laboured hard all ones life long, if he faulter in the end. The ſole laſt moment of perſeverance is more avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable then all the years by paſt; for all their fruit proves rotten if it did not borrow thence a preſerving ſoundnes.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt think it a hard task to perſever, but it is much harder to begin again, and much more then that to begin often. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is both more eaſy and more conducible, to perſever once then to begin often. Horſes force themſelves les in a continued courſe of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:39021:173"/> drawing a chariot, then, after having ſtood ſtil, when they are to move it again. Water which hath been once heated, being taken of the fire, becomes more cold then at firſt. If fervour be wanting in thy proceedings thou alſo perchance wilt be more tepid then in the beginning. Many grow faint-harted in the courſe of perſeverance becauſe they find diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in doing good; but they do not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evade that difficulty; for it is only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance that makes all eaſy. If thou hadſt the courage to begin a hard task, thou mayſt wel continue it, that being much more eaſy. Thou haſt found ſo long by experience that it is neyther diſproportioned to thy ſtrength nor grace; why then contrary to ſo long proof art thou now diffident, thinking thy ſelf unable to bear it? what is eyther paſt or to come is not burdenſome for the preſent: do not graſp the difficulty all at once, for it comes not ſo but by piece meale, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menſurate to the parts of time. As thou waſt able before to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it ſo art thou now, and wil be henceforth. It wil not be more noyſome then it was, but the heat of the difficulty wil remit by length of time and cuſtome. Accuſtome thy ſelf to do wel, and thou wilt forget to do ill. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome overcomes difficulty becauſe it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes nature, and what then wil grace do? if cuſtome overcome nature much more wil a wel-orderd charity in thee overcome the deordinations of nature.</p>
                  <p>It is better many times to fulfil a good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:39021:174"/> or conſummate a work already begun then to begin another though otherwiſe more perfect; becauſe by inuring thy ſelf &amp; yeald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a ficklenes of mind, neither wilt thou performe that other. Seldome can any work occur which is better then conſtancy in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling a good purpoſe. Good purpoſes are to be kept although they be not of any great regard; becauſe albeit in themſelves it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports but little whether they be kept or no, yet it is extremely important to be conſtant &amp; no wayes changeable. Who is more conſtant in making good purpoſes then he who leaſt intends to keep them. If thou learnſt a firm perſeverance in one good againſt another, thou wilt learn it more firmly againſt evil, &amp; wilt not vary like time in this time of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God. O eternal truth, grant me grace to ſerve thee eternally: help, o Chriſt my weaknes, thou who with ſuch indefatigable love tookeſt upon thee all our infirmities; thou who never art weary with tolerating my impudent negligences, grant that I may never be negligent any more, nor deſiſt impudently from thy ſervice, but may learn to brook &amp; ſwallow all morſels of difficulty. Let me learn, o Lord, perſeverance by thy love, who when thou lovedſt thine, thou didſt love them even to the end: thou who didſt perſever hanging upon the croſs, and wouldſt not deſert it, though the Iewes promiſed upon that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to believe in thee the Son of God: who being ful of irkſomnes anguiſh, and a bloody
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:39021:174"/> ſweat didſt perſiſt nevertheles, and ſeeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs by red oubling thy prayers.</p>
                  <p>Go too, o remiſs ſpirit, tel me, what muſt thou covet to do for thy IESVS, who perſevered for thee amidſt the ſorrowes of death and the croſs: who when he loved thee loved thee even to death, what, I ſay, muſt thou covet, but to do good and ſuffer evil. Theſe are the chief ambition of a ſoul that loves IESVS, that which makes moſt for perſeverance. A good work preſents it ſelf; what hinders thee from doing it but the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which accompanies it? but mark wel that here concurs a ſecond commodity of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, and attend now that the good is doubled: ther is ſuperadded to this work both to ſuffer evil and do good. Thou canſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no excuſe for thy non-perſeverance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that only hinders thee which ought to be the ſum of thy deſire, to ſuffer for thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. If the love of IESVS were enkindled in thee, all backwardnes tribulation, and extrinſecal impediments would no more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thee then fire is with wood, which forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with more inflames it. But if thou be ſo coldly chil that the love of God finds no fewel to feed on, let thy own advantage and hope of future joy incite thee. Diſpair of coming off with life is wont to add valour to ſouldiers &amp; make them way through the thickeſt dangers: divine hope of eternal life is yet more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and wil make thee more valiant and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. With this hope attempt thy enterprizes,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:39021:175"/> and perſever cheerfully. A cheerfull accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance feels neyther labours nor trouble, though otherwiſe the thing be laborious enough. He that exerciſeth himſelf in mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary games or at ball is wont to take more paines then one that hires himſelf forth to day-task; and yet he feels it not, becauſe he takes it by way of pleaſure and content.</p>
                  <p>If thou wilt conclude happily in the laſt hour, be ſure to begin each hour; if thou intend to perſever, begin alwayes a new. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe not thy negligence by indiſpoſition of body: ſelf love for the moſt part deceives thee, and makes thee do thy actions remiſly. Thy body is able to do more then thou thinkſt if thy fervour of mind were but vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, its force infuſing ſtrength even into weak and feeble limbs. A lunatique perſon though exhauſted with ſicknes can do more then 4. that are ſound: the vigour of our mind ſometimes communicates it ſelf to the body. If the infirmity of a malady can make one ſtrong, how much more the ſtrength of grace and health of ſoul when he loves God and confides in him.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>GO to the covetous man, o remiſs ſpirit, and learn ſollicitude and arts of induſtry. No great matter is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of thee if to become the beſt thou be ſet to imitate the worſt. No greater diligence is exacted of thee to pleaſe God then many uſe to pleaſe no body, yea to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe all. Be confounded not to do for the kingdom of heaven what is ordinarily done for a trifle of money. No more is required of thee to obtain great grace and glory, then the ſinner of his own accord undergoes for vice &amp; hell. Thou maiſt with credit be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of grace; and canſt not be too minutely attentive in improving thy ſpiritual ſtock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtudious habits incline to action: for which reaſon it is proper to vertue to reflect not what is don but what is to be done, not what is acquired but what is behind: and therfore it never is in a ſtable poſſeſſion but allwayes in purſuit and ſollicitude. It delights not in things paſt, but takes incentives from things to come. It is covetous, it thirſts, it burns; ſeeming ſtill to it ſelf more indigent the more it gets.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that hunger after temporal things
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:39021:176"/> incur the hatred of all men; becauſe they are profitable neyther to themſelves nor others: yea they endammage others either by uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or hindering or denying them tranſitory goods, and depriving themſelves of eternal. Contrary wiſe thoſe that hoard up ſpiritual treaſures are deemd harmles, they are in the favour &amp; eſteem of all, becauſe they enrich themſelves without the prejudice of another. True goods are of this nature that they are able to ſatisfy all parties without fear of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming, or cauſing impeachment to anothers wealth. In ſpiritual goods avarice is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, in temporal it is deteſtable: for the firſt are to be hoarded up, the latter to be diſtributed abroad; otherwiſe they are not goods unles they be emploid after a good manner: but ſpiritual avail not unles they be conſerved; yet nevertheles they are not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed but rather augmented by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Diſdain not then to do that with cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and profit which others forbear with the general diſlike &amp; diſadvantage both of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and all. The miſer prizeth one half penny as dearly as his life, and if he chance to looſe it he takes on pittifully: and ſo muſt thou, if through thy negligence thou ſuſtain any detriment of grace, or ſlip any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of improving it. The covetous rack their brains to invent new wayes of gain; &amp; thou muſt employ thy wits in deviſing how to advance in grace. Eſteem nothing little, but have a moſt high conceit of all that ſtands in
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:39021:176"/> the rank of heavenly goods. Even as reaſon corrects the eye judging the ſtars to be as little as they ſeem, and convinceth it that each of them is much greater then the whole globe of the earth: ſo muſt thou rectify thy dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens in a falſe eſtimate of theſe things, and perſwade thy ſelf that the leaſt improvement of grace is more valuable then the ſoveraignty of the whole world. Let thy eye lids all wayes precede thy ſteps, that thou maiſt be able to diſtinguiſh and pick up the little Margarits of merits amidſt the dung of humane employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Let this be thy chief care, next to good works, in the frequent and fervent uſe of the Sacraments. O immenſe liberality of God, which haſt left thoſe immenſe treaſures of thy Church unlockt, that every one might take as much as he liſted. Let us rate the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Sacraments duly, and let the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of our avarice diſcharge and diſburden it ſelf upon them, for they are the mines of grace. A miſer that looſeth whole nights ſleep for a trifle of money, that ſets ſo many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins on work for that end, that puts himſelf upon the tenter hooks of a carking pain, if he ſhould ſee the exchequer of a moſt wealthy king ſtanding open, and the king himſelf begging of him to take thence as much and as often as he would, and ſhould ſtill importune him to carry away more and more, would he let ſlip this fair opportunity of enriching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? this is Chriſts proceeding with thee in
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:39021:177"/> the inſtitution of the Sacraments. Thou muſt not only diſpoſe thy ſelf in ſuch ſort as not to be fruſtrated of their effect; but thou muſt love them, and frequent them often, and diſpoſe thy ſelf worthily to receive more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious grace. Diſpoſition is the veſſel that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it and the greater that is, and more ardent thy affection, the larger portion ſhal befall thee; the leaſt grain wherof is more to be valved then all kingdomes and natures univerſe. The blood of Chriſt diſtils into theſe veſſels as did the oyl from the widowes oylpot; neyther wil it ſtop its current til they be all fully repleniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Vſe alſo this little craft in thy holy avarice, and procure by all thy works to gain, if thou canſt, a double grace: offering them to beg a worthy acceſs to the Sacraments; and by ſo doing thou ſhalt both receive grace for the merit of thy work and thou mayſt hope to receive yet another in regard of thy better diſpoſition, which God wil give beholding thy affection and ſollicitude for a good prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Beg likewiſe of thy Ghoſtly Father that all thy works may be enjoynd thee for ſatisfaction of thy ſins. Be alſo devoutly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards all the ſacrifices of Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Body and blood that are offerd through the whole world; covetting if it were poſſible to be preſent at them all; however offer them up to God; being thus diſpoſed thou ſhalt reap more ample fruit. Carry alſo a ſembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble devotion to all the general prayers of the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:39021:177"/> Church for her children, as alſo to thoſe of the faythful, that being thus piouſly diſpoſed thou mayſt partake more plentifully of them. Yea he that is in mortal ſin which cannot be thought on without horrour, muſt not omit to do all this in token of the reverence he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes to a worthy reception of the Sacraments, with a good purpoſe and earneſt deſire of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his ſins. By this meanes his good works which otherwiſe are barren of grace in reſpect of merit, wil afterwards in ſome manner be fruitful in the Sacrament by reaſon of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to which they conduce: for although grace ſhal not be given for their regard, yet it wil for the good diſpoſal which he may hope for by ſo diligent a preparation. This ſoare being thus cured, covet alſo to diſpoſe thy ſelf worthily towards the Sacrament of Extreme-Vnction, that thou mayſt have it in ſtore when thou ſhalt chance to ſtand in need of being anneald.</p>
                  <p>The ſervant of God muſt be attentive over ſuch ſmal nyceties, and not permit one crum of grace to fall which he may ſave; &amp; uſing this induſtry all his life long he ſhall gather a vaſt treaſure: neyther muſt be ſuffer that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of gain, a deſirous wil, to lye idle; let him be deſirous to do what he is not able to execute. Let him be moſt wealthy in good deſires: when he ſees, heares, or reads any ſignal act of vertu let him wiſh to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized it; let him burn with a holy and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous envy; perchance he ſhal obtain like grace.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:39021:178"/> To approve ſin is the ſelf-ſame as to commit it, in like manner to deſire earneſtly an act of vertue wil not want its due reward. God is more facil and forward in rewarding then puniſhing. The covetous man leaves nothing which he comprizeth not in deſire, although that make only for his greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: what would he do, if no ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſird but forthwith poſſeſſed. This felicity and facility of uſury is only to be found in a holy and ſpiritual avarice. Deſires wil not prove a torment to the ſervant of God but a fruit and comfort: he ſhal preſently be made partaker of like merit. Let us covet eternal goods with advantage, ſince worldlings co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet temporal with grief and diſappointment. How eaſy a gain is it which is purchaſed at the coſt of a ſole deſire! conſider the ample reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of deſire, and how rich thou mayſt be by onely willing, and ſuffer not that which yealds ſuch a plentiful incoming to lye vacant. Be upon all occaſions wiſhing to have not only the actual but even poſſible merits of all the Angels and Saints in heaven, ſo to be more pleaſing to God; and thou ſhalt reap a moſt rich harveſt from the labours and ſervices of others. Wiſh likewiſe to thy utmoſt power and unfaignedly to ſuffer what is poſſible for a creature to endure: and ſince all the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary actions thou canſt do for him, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exceſs of thy obligation, are but very few, glean here and there ſome more; and make advantage even of thy neceſſary
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:39021:178"/> works ſeating, ſleeping, and the like; and of them alſo make an oblation. Procure more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to elevate works of themſelves but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable to the higheſt pitch of vertue: &amp; by ſo doing thou ſhalt acquire more copious grace. Do all what thou doſt for the love of God. What greater felicity imaginable then together with ſo great gain not to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from him whom thou coveteſt &amp; oughſt to covet above all. Be ambitious of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of grace and uſe of the Sacraments, that thou mayſt be more pleaſing to God, more comely and gracious in his eyes. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt thou be more ſollicitous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe grace then fearful to looſe it through idlenes by light defects and lazynes. Vnite all thy works and labours and offer them joyntly with thoſe of Chriſt; for ſo they wil deſerve a more gracious regard at the hands of God. Mony which is les currant being mixt with ſtore of currant paſſeth for ſuch and receives its full value: a drop of water falling into a veſſel of wine puts on the nature and relliſh of wine. And to the end thou mayſt ſerve God in all cleannes of hart, be devoutly affected towards Indulgences. Purpoſe daily at thy riſing to gain them all, and to uſe for that end thy utmoſt endeavour: offer and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate them to God, having firſt dedicated thy ſelf and all that is thine to his ſole glory; and thou muſt reiterate this thy intention fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently through the day: if thou conſiderſt what he is towards thee and what in himſelf,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:39021:179"/> thou wilt find that thou haſt not as yet given him a ſatisfactory diſcharge of thy obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

Men are wont to be a litle troubled out of a reverential reſpect, if they be to ſpeak to the King in their own behalf: and ſhal we be more ſluggiſh and diſreſpectful in the kings own concern, he himſelf being both ſpectatour and auditour? deſervedly ſhal he be accurſed who praiſeth not God with ſuch diligence as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeems him. Behold the Angels and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures buſied in praiſing and honouring their Lord and Creator be thou aſhamed by ſlouth, ſilence, or ſinfulnes to contemn him. How abſurd and extravagant a pallat hath he that is allwaies diſliking what all the world beſides extols and magnifyes? o Lord, let not me by my diſtractednes and negligence make my prayers and thy prayſes evil and ſinful, all evils being to be redreſſed by them. How can
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:39021:179"/> I find any place for diſtractions, ſince it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooves me to make amends in this hour for the diſtractednes of ſo many men who ſcarſe lend thee a good thought? with what reſpect muſt I behave my ſelf, ſince thou wilt have me ſupply for all ſinners that diſhonour thee, for all infants that are ignorant of thee, and all creatures that are ſpeechles. But why; o Lord, doſt thou ſo much eſteem the prayſes of ſo vile a miſcreant? is the maſter of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily any whit more glorious for being prayſd by his children or meaneſt ſervants? that may be ſo, becauſe they ſhew the content they find in his ſervice and houſe, where all from the higheſt to the loweſt are extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely pleaſed with ſuch a maſter. It was Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids glory that his victory was celebrated not only by his courtiers but hand-mayds alſo. God is glorified by being prayſed by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels whom he glorifyes, and ſometimes much more by men whom he humbles &amp; mortifies. How good indeed art thou, o Lord, that even thoſe, to whom thou ſheweſt thy ſelf harſh and bitter, are lowd proclamers of thy goodnes! each day will I magnify thee and in all ſeaſons promiſcuouſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of day, of joy, or affliction.</p>
                  <p>Learn, o man, how acceptable it is to God to be truly prayſed and with deſert, by that joy thou thy ſelf conceiveſt when thou art prayſed falſely and without deſert. It is much alike to prayſe God as if thou gaveſt him his divinity. God is wont to accept the affection
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:39021:180"/> in lieu of the effect, when this implies an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility. He takes ſo much content in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a holy ſoul gaze upon him, that he begs of her to look another way, becauſe her eyes make him as it were proud, and force him to withdraw his preſence: but how much more will ſhe afford him when ſhe ſtands admiring his perfections as one abſorpt, ſeeking acceſs by love ſongs and Panegyricks full of ſweet affection? we offend thee, o Lord by our tongue as an Vniverſity which makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all iniquity: let me purge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it by the regulated Vniverſity of thy goodnes and attributes. Let me wipe off that infamous ſtain of mans tongue which cryed thee to the croſs, and let me extol thee above the Cherubins and Seraphins. Thou didſt looſe, o Lord, many Angels whoſe ſole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment was to praiſe thee: I am bound to give thee many thanks for chuſing me a poor miſcreant to ſupply ſome one of their places even among the blaſphemies of thoſe that offend thee. O how grateful is to thee the prayſe of a pious ſoul amidſt the curſes of ſo many infidels, as if one ſhould hear a night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingal warble amidſt a confuſed quire of chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſparrowes. Thou demandeſt o Lord, that thy voyce may ſound in my eares: how can I deny my voice to God ſpeaking to me and giving his word. O immenſe Father, who gaveſt me thy Son thy word to be a revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement to all for my ſake; all my words are due to thee, that thou mayſt be praiſed in all
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:39021:180"/> by me. By thy word thou gaveſt all things their being; it is but equitable that by words at leaſt we acknowledg and be grateful for what thy word did.</p>
                  <p>If I were a labouring beaſt I would carry a burden; if a fat beaſt I would go to the ſhambles; if an oxe I would ſtoop to the yoak; I would comply with the duty of all theſe: but becauſe I am a rational creature; I wil do whats proper to me, that is, prayſe God: this is mans duty, this is the task of a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoul, the ſong that it muſt ſing, and I wil invite all creatures on all occaſions to joyn in quire with me. My task is not a task of burden and labour but of tongue and ſong, of that which leſſens and eaſeth labour. Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band men and artificers are wont to ſing ſo to mitigate the irkſomnes of their work: why am I negligent in a thing ſo eaſy and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>If I were a nightingal I would take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſinging and do my duty: I am a man; why ſhall not I take pleaſure in magnifying God, complying in this with my nature? I will practiſe my ſelf here in the ſchool of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane miſeries in this exerciſe of the B. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which muſt be my task through all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and now as it were by way of trial I am to ſhew how I will act my part in that ſcene of glory. I will intrude my ſelf into the quires of Angels that the jarring diſcords of my ſong may be drownd in the melodiouſnes of their harmony. If Angels have been ſeen to
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:39021:181"/> conſort with men while they religiouſly ſing in the quire; I will conſort my ſelf with the quires of Angels, and imagin my ſelf preſent there while I ſing divine prayſes; or among the Diſciples and Chriſt when having ſupped they recited a hymn of thanks giving. O moſt ſweet IESV, who will be able to imitate the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with which thou ſaydſt or ſungſt that hymn? it was equivalent to that, though it ſhewed not it ſelf exteriourly which thou ſhortly after didſt exhibite in thy bloody ſweat when thou ſtoodſt in need of an Angel to comfort thee eyther by prayſing thee or compaſſionating thy caſe. Grant, o Lord, that I may laudably performe the office of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel by prayſing thee laudably. Grant, o Lord, that in memory of thy paſſion I may at all times compaſſionate and comfort thee. But thou much more coveteſt this ſmal ſolace of thy affliction to ſee me attentive, humble, &amp; fervently zealous in diſcharging thy prayſes, chiefly in the divine Office that I do it not with precipitation, but at a fit and ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hour.</p>

Becauſe the divine Office is recited in private that muſt not be a pretence to perform it more remiſly or negligently:
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:39021:181"/> but thou muſt endeavour by a devout obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to ſupply the fruit which redounds from prayer in common or publick, in ſuch ſort that thy very reverence may attractively invite thither the Angels; as did that devout ſervant of God Iohn Fernandius a Father of our Society who by a ſpecial favour from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſaid divine Office with an Angel: do thou at leaſt imagine one to be preſent and recite with thee, that thou mayſt learn reverence of him, and how thou art to diſcharge that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation both worthily and profitably.</p>
                  <p>O ſoul, how uſeles art thou to God whilſt neyther his prayſe nor glory poſſeſſeth thy hart nor mouth! he denyes himſelf to be the work of God who neglects to prayſe God, to whom each creature is barren that yealds not this harveſt of prayſe. Divine prayſe &amp; glory is the fruit of man; God can or rather daignes to reap this increaſe and advantage his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, from his creatures. O immenſe goodnes to be magnifyd by all. If thy creature owe thee prayſe becauſe he is the work of thy hands, how much will he owe thee becauſe thou prayſedſt him firſt? thou createdſt all things, o Lord, as wel as prayſedſt them by approving them as good, and giving them thy bleſſing: why ſhal not I bleſs thee, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and ſee how good thou art? how great a dignity is it, o man, that God ſhould covet thy approbation and prayſe! thou muſt prayſe him with as much ſeriouſnes, as if all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation depended upon thy prayſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:39021:182"/> Procure to be good and juſt: for prayſe from the unjuſt is held by wiſe men disprayſe, and they account it the ſame to be prayſd by the lecherous and for lechery. One had good reaſon to ſay that our credit was les beholding to a ſlack and faint prayſer then to a bitter detractor: may it not happen now and then that a blind ignorant &amp; blaſphemous heathen may les obſtruct the exaltation of Chriſt and glory of God then ſome religious man who performes his dutyes of devotion with drouzines, immodeſty, diſtraction, &amp; irreverence. A frigid commendation is eſteemd among men no better then a plain reproach: and perchance ſuch an irreverend manner of prayſing God may ſomtimes be held next to blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>The firſt inventer of prayſe was God; and the firſt doctrine he taught me was to prayſe him: the firſt benefit he beſtowd upon crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their infancy, was prayſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of their goodnes. O the dignity of prayſe which God alone was worthy to invent! he would have other inventions to be aſcribed to man, but he himſelf would own that of prayſe.

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:39021:183"/> if when Chriſt crownd with thornes, ſteept in his own ſweat and blood, loaden with his croſs, pinioned with cords, exhauſted in his ſtrength, through waight of the tree and feeblenes cauſed by the foregoing torments, fell to the ground, if, I ſay, thou hadſt then heard the voyce of this Father ſpeaking from heaven moſt lovingly to thee in theſe words: my wil is that thou dye for mankind in place of my only begotten Son, and accompliſh the work for which I deſigned my own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved child. O the deſire of my hart, how come I to be worthy of this? who would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch a bleſsing upon me, which I am much more ambitious off then to be in a preſent poſſeſsion of glory? how unſpeakable a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy ſhould I repute it if I were thought worthy only to help thee with Cyrenaeus in carrying thy croſs?

A much greater favour and more ſpecial grace is granted to a prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Conſider in the mean time when the prieſt comes to ſacrifice, that thou receiveſt a precept from the eternal Father to be Chriſts ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute in order to dying: when thou putteſt on the ſacred veſtments thou doſt nothing elſe but tranſplant the crown of thornes from Chriſts hand upon thy own head, put on his garment, bind thy ſelf with his cords, and carry his croſs. Conſider what thou goeſt to do, and take thoſe ſacred ornaments as if thou receivedſt from Chriſts hands the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of his paſſion which he preferred much before the heavens thou contemplates. Now when the prieſt comes forth thus veſted what atrain of Angels doth attend him? if fewer had been created then de facto are, perſwade thy ſelf, they would ſooner have left heaven va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and the guardianſhip of men, then the attendance &amp; aſſiſtance of him that celebrates. When a king deputes a Vice-roy or ſends an Embaſſador about his affaires or publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:39021:184"/> all the peers and nobles accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him, though for that interim they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh both king &amp; court: ſuch a concourſe make the Angels to honour and aſſiſt Chriſts deputy; and they are the more forward ſince by ſo doing they honour the Perſon it ſelf of their king and Lord of glory, who becomes after a wonderful manner preſent in the maſs. With what humility and modeſty ought a prieſt to approach the altar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but now when the time of ſacrifice is at hand, let him redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his wiſhes of dying in lieu of Chriſt for the ranſome of all mankind. He may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the whole world hanging in a deep ſuſpenſe, the doleful cries of the ſoules in purgatory, the endles ſins of men, the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable dangers of the juſt, the neceſſities of the diſtreſſed, the inflamed deſires of the bleſſed, the profuſe joy of the Angels, and all theſe contemplating his ſacrifice: and the prieſt then knowing that his own death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſatisfactory for all, let him rejoyce exceedingly that Chriſt is again allotted for the ſacrifice, he who alone was able to make a full ſatisfactory amends; as alſo for that God accepting of the prieſts good wil, as he did formerly of that of Abraham and Iſaac, would again ſubſtitute for victime an innocent ram and lamb who takes away the ſins of the world: one that will abundantly ſatisfy for all, freeing the prieſt from becoming an obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or being immolated; but conferring nevertheles upon him the honour &amp; dignity
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:39021:184"/> of ſo great a function and embaſſy. The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctime that is to be offerd for the ſins of the world muſt be without blemiſh of ſin: but becauſe none but Chriſt is ſo qualified, it was requiſite that that high prieſt &amp; Prelate ſhould offer himſelf, he who needs not to make an oblation firſt for his own miſdemeanours, &amp; then for thoſe of the people.</p>
                  <p>I ſee not, o prieſt vicegerent of Chriſt, how thou canſt chuſe here but melt and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate away through an exceſs of joy and love, if any one did lie in priſon as being lyable to ſome great crime or debt which he were not able to clear or cancel, and another ſhould come &amp; as bountifully as unexpectedly beſtow upon him what were requiſite for a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, how would he be overwhelmed with joy. Behold thou art wholly uncapable of making God any proportionable ſatisfaction either for his favours or thy own fault, thou being infinitly obliged to him upon ſo many other ſcores, and hopeles of thy ſelf ever to quit them; and if thou loveſt God after a ſincere manner this ought to be an afflicting corroſive to thy hart: what jubily muſt needs ſieze thee when Chriſt comes into thy hands, and makes himſelf thy oblation to his Father for a plenary ſatisfaction? certainly he that loves God ought both day and night to be in expectation of this hour wherein poor miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant man offers to an infinite God that which will be infinitly pleaſing to him, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he needs not now dread the debt of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:39021:185"/> his own ſins as not having wherwith to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it. Pay thy ſelf, o Lord, for my ſins, and reſtore to me what is overplus and I ſhal be rich enough, the reſidue amounting to an infinitude. I offer moreover, that to thee in all their behalf for whome Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd himſelf upon the croſs for thy glory, for thy mercies imparted to the whole world, for the coming of the H. Ghoſt that he may breath upon my ſoul and inflame it with his lightſome ardours.</p>
                  <p>But with how great charity and obedience muſt I make this oblation of Chriſt? with ſo much greater then Abraham did when he was to ſacrifice his deareſt Son, by how much Chriſt exceeds Iſaac, and the common cauſe of all mankind the particular of one ſingle man. If God ſhould have commanded the moſt B. Virgin as he did Abraham to ſacrifice for mans redemption her only and dearly beloved Son; and ſhe full of a motherly affection were to naile his hands and feet to the croſs; with what vehement flames of love amidſt a torrent of teares, with what quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, promptitude, and obedience would ſhe have done it, deeming her ſelf happy for ſuch a task? o prieſt, conſider what an office is deputed to thee, that thou thy ſelf art the ſacrificer of the Son of the Virgin the Son of God. But a greater favour is done to thee then would be done in that caſe to the moſt H. Mother of God: for thou never canſt thank God ſufficiently for inventing a meanes
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:39021:185"/> how thou mighteſt ſacrifice the Son of God without any payn to him, without expenſe of blood or the torments of death, and mayſt offer all the paynes of IESVS, all his blood and deadly pangs to his Father, in the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame manner as if they were here really exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>
                  <p>Stand amazd, o Prieſt, at thy function, behold the world all in ſuſpenſe over thee! how dreadfull is it to ſee thee ſtand voyd of all attention, where thou ſhouldſt be repleniſhd with an awfull veneration, and immerſed in the dregs of creatures, while thou performeſt an office next in dignity to the divinity it ſelf? when thou elevateſt the body of Chriſt thou draweſt all the Saints to ſuch a ſpectacle, and engageſt (as I conceive) the eyes and knees of the admiring Angels; and yet for all this canſt thou be diſtracted? the very dead them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves adore God in thy hands, as a devout ſervant of God F. Peter Savedra beheld the body of S. Didacus to ariſe and worſhip Chriſt in the hands of the prieſt: and canſt thou thy ſelf who elevateſt him, be in the mean time unmindfull of ſo redoubted a majeſty, and not reverence him from the depth of thy hart? contemplate round about thee the Hierarchies of Angels with bended knees and multitudes of divels forced to an humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment: for if each knee both cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial, terreſtrial, and infernal bend at the name of IESVS, how much more will they at the preſence of IESVS?</p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:39021:186"/>
                  <p> Conſider how ſignal thy purity ought to be who art appointed Chriſts ſubſtitute to cleanſe the world by him from its ſinful ordures. Thou ſhouldſt not appear like a man but a very Angel, and ſhine more purely then the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens themſelves. What do I ſay? o how mean and diſproportioned is the compariſon of an Angel to a prieſt! ſince the power of prieſtly dignity is higher exalted above the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of a nature Angelical, then is an Angel in its kind above a worm. God who is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely good was pleaſed to honour his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by calling them into part of his charge and providence: he deſignd the Angels chiefly for his coadjutors and Vice-gerents in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things; and therfore made them publique miniſters of nature not diſpenſers of grace and his ſubſtitutes in the work of our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. They preſide over the parts of the earth and chief quarters of the world: it is their task to conſerve the kinds and natures of things: but as for producing in others the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural guift of grace they have no lawful nay nor any ordinary authority, as Prieſts have, whom he choſe for his immediate coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutours in the ſtupendious work of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and juſtification: they as the Vicars of Chriſt diſpence forth grace and make men the children of God. They exerciſe a kind of power over the naturall Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf IESVS while they conſecrate his Body and offer ſacrifice. They work prodigious miracles. The Angels take complacence in
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:39021:186"/> ſerving a Prieſt, as they did Saint Euſebius, eſteeming this ſervice a high piece of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. How much is grace elevated abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve nature? certainly more ſublimely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compariſon then the nature of an Angel is above dung. How much will guarding a man fall ſhort of making a man God by elevating him to a divine ſtate. Which is more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to have a care of one or of all; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for one or all; to govern ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars or appeaſe God for the generality? thou mayſt hence conclude how eminently a Prieſt is priviledgd in power above an Angel. The ſole dignity of Chriſt is onely worthy of Prieſthood: IESVS alone as being the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of God obtaynes by title of right a dignifying dignity. Notwithſtanding this, o Mary moſt loving Mother, Mother of Chriſt and all ſinners, cloath me in the garments of thy firſt begotten by a perfect imitation of life, as Rebecca did Iacob, that I may at leaſt with leſs unworthines offer that lamb to his eternall Father which thou gaveſt me for a delicious diſh, on which thou knoweſt him to feed with much guſt and appetite.</p>

Charity uſed a ſtrange diſpoſall when it ordaind that I ſhould be thy manſion-houſe and thou ſhouldſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in me and I in thee, I living for thee as thou for thy Father; thou deſiring nothing of me nor for me beſides thy ſelf, nor ceaſeſt thou to covet upon ſo due a ſcore or juſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, though preſcinding from thy ſelf, thou findeſt nothing in me deſirable.</p>

                  <p> Come, o Lord, come and take poſſeſſion of my hart, which thy deſires moſt juſtly challenge. O how much do I betray my nothing, nor can I reſiſt this claym of deſires! was it not ſufficient, o beneſicent truth, to have obligd me with deeds and guifts; why was it neceſſary to engage me with thy deſires? my miſeries have bereaud me of all comfort: for ſeing my works to carry but ſmal propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with thy benefits, it was ſome relief to endeavour ſatisfaction by wiſhes and deſires: but they alſo becoming due to thee, what now is remnant? o Lord, how worthily art thou the butt, of all deſires who deſird ſo deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly! how can I have leaſure to fix my deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res upon any thing els beſides thee, the God of deſire! how can my thoughts or concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcible powers ſuſpend themſelves from the deſire of thy moſt H.

In other Sacraments &amp; participations of grace, he is made one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with God; but in this he moreover be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes one fleſh with Ieſus, ſuch a ſtrict union interceding that it is tearmd by the H.

Virgin hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and worſhipd with ſo much devotion: being jointly two in one fleſh; I being able to glory and ſay, I am now fleſh of Chriſt, &amp; a bone of the bones of IESVS. This is a great Sacrament in Chriſt and his Church, by that
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:39021:188"/> myſtery in which we become concorporeal with the king of glory, the Son of God and the Virgin Mary. Now loving thee, o Lord, I wil love my ſelf; for no body ever hated his own fleſh: and thou loving thy fleſh, lovedſt me alſo making both thine &amp; mine joynt-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the ſame favours, treating mine as thy own by the priviledg of the reſurrection: for although other juſt men both antient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets &amp; Patriarchs, were not to enjoy a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, yet thoſe ſhould who dye partakers of this Sacrament of our Lords Body; neyther ſhal this befall them only in regard of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of their ſoul, but alſo for the dignity of their fleſh. O Lord, thou waſt deſired by all nations that common nature might ſhare of thy communications: why do not I deſire thee, that thou mayſt become individual to me &amp; one with me by that admirable inconfuſed conjunction with my particular fleſh &amp; ſpirit?</p>
                  <p>Therfore, o Lord becauſe we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire as we ought, thou didſt vouchſafe to do it, leaſt ſo great a benefit ſhould be deprived of its due love &amp; eſteem. Thou cauſedſt other bleſsings to be ſought, and chiefly that of the Incarnation; but thou wouldſt have the inſtitution of the venerable myſtery of thy body and blood to come merely gratis with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the expenſe of the deſires of all nations. That Sacrament came as an unexpected boon and unlookd-for charity, that all our deſires might be reſerved and employd in a due rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of it, and yet for all this we are not
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:39021:188"/> enflamed! a deſire of this myſtery is ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to thee, that thou wonderfully ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condeſt it, and condeſcendeſt to a ſoul that longs to receive thee. B. Staniſlaus a novice of our Society being more then once in ſuch acondition that he could not ſatiate his long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire by feeding on this celeſtial bread, with much ardour of devotion deſired what he could not then enjoy, and forthwith the Angels brought what he deſird, and made him eat of that ſacred banquet. Becauſe the Body of Chriſt is ſeldome received with a due deſire, God would not let this occaſion of a worthy reception ſlip or fruſtrate it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding that B. ſoul in ſuch a ſpiritual famine and eagernes of appetite.</p>
                  <p>Thou taughtſt us, o IESV, teacher of all truth, to come to this Sacrament with much tendernes of devotion: but we do not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the devotion thou exhibitedſt towards it, by deſiring. I know not how we can, if we love Chriſt, behold this myſtery without weeping eyes: for a ſpouſe cannot behold the pledg which her fellow-ſpouſe, bidding adieu towards a long journy, left her for a memorial, without a longing deſire of his return. We muſt not only endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it worthily but even as worthily as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly we can. For beſides that an infinite ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty requires all poſsible reverence, and the immenſe ſanctity of IESVS all purity imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, we ſhal derive thence a great increaſe of grace. Thou gaveſt us, o Lord, 3. docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:39021:189"/> to make us approach it with greater worthines; a fervent love in deſiring, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite purity, a profound humility which thou didſt exhibit in waſhing the feet of thy Diſciples. What ſhal I ſay of purity? thou oughteſt, o lover of Chriſt, in thy acceſs to this table, to poſſeſs it in ſuch eminency, that its beames muſt be no leſs refined, then if thou wert preſently to give up the ghoſt. Thou muſt endeavour with more earneſtnes, deſire, and ſollicitude to prepare thy ſelf to the Euchariſt then to death; nay, in ſome reſpect of profit, more then if thou wert a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to enter into the glory of God. IESVS waſhed the feet of his Diſciples being to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part his Body to them although they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready clean; and notwithſtanding when he ſent them like lambs in the midſt of wolves, in ſuch a preſent hazard of death; &amp; when he took them along with him to Mount Tabor as eyewitneſſes of his glorious Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he uſed no ſuch preparative; nor when in glory he eat with them after his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. One would be pretty wel diſpoſed for death if he were but in the ſtate of grace: for although he were not altogether free from tax of paine or venial culpablenes, yet before he ſtood in the preſence of God he would be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyd by cleanſing flames. I wiſh with all my hart that a Purgatory did precede the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this Sacrament! but becauſe it doth not, it imports me to look moſt narrowly into my ſelf, and prepare and refine my ſelf from
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:39021:189"/> the leaſt blemiſh of imperfection or debt of any penalty, and ſupply as wel as I can by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and an ardent love the fire of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: and although all immunity both from paine and fault be requiſite to gain admittance into glory, nevertheles no reſpect is had but to precedent grace and works; neyther is the divine indulgence doubled in regard of the diſpoſition as it is diſtinct from merit: but in the Euchariſt a more ample clayme and title to glory wil be acquird even in regard of each ones diſpoſal, over and above that which is allotted to his merits: &amp; he that makes it his task to till the ſoyle of his ſoul and diſpoſe it better and better, the richer Crop ſhal he reap thence, beſides the reward of his good works: one ought to be much more ambitious of pleaſing God and ſtanding gracious in his eyes which is the effect of grace then of joying in the fruition of his glory, if the amplenes of his beatitude were not commenſurately correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding to his grace &amp; the proportion which God holds. All mediums that diſpoſe us to glory by good works, diſtinct from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, obtaine grace under one only title; but preparation to the Euchariſt under a double &amp; gains afterwards a double degree of beatitude.</p>
                  <p>Purity is ſo beſeemingly requiſite in order to this Sacrament that the divine providence hath ordaind, that, even as it precedes the ſacrifice of Chriſt, it be propitiatory for our ſins, it having vertu to remit the very pain due to their fault; Chriſt himſelf whom we
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:39021:190"/> receive is pleaſd firſt of all to cleanſe us, as he did the feet of his Diſciples, cer he would give himſelf to us or deliver himſelf for us. He ſhewd by that waſhing, that not any kind of purity was ſufficient but that a ſpecial one was neceſſary; for he would not only have the hands of his Diſciples clean, which ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth for ordinary banquets, but their feet alſo which ſignifyes a very extraordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. God declard hereby that we are to come to the Euchariſt not only with clean hands, that is, works devoyd of all fault, but alſo with clean feet, that is to ſay, without ſo much as any print or ſign of fault, viz, the paine due to tepid actions or ſins remitted being quite aboliſhed: and in this ſort grace proper to this ſacrifice is powerful to cancel the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty due to ſin.</p>
                  <p>How ſhal I come worthily, o Lord, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee? what a treaſure of ſanctity was beſtowd upon S. Iohn Baptiſt that his mouth might figuratively entertain not thee but thy name, ſaying behold the lamb of God; and he expreſs the ſhadow of one of thy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? but what purity ought to inveſt me who am to approach that venerable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and receive thee truly and really into my mouth? o I wiſh I could entertain thee with as much reverence, as the moſt B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mother did in her ſacred womb in that ſtupendious hour of thy Incarnation; or as ſhe embraced thy moſt H. Body in her boſome when it was taken down from the croſs, and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:39021:190"/> thy heavenly Father received thy ſpirit at thy expiring, when it was recommended into his hands. What thou dividedſt o Lord, in thy death betwixt thy Father and Mother, all that do I here adore in this Sacrament after thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: for thy ſoul remaynes not ſeparate from thy Body. Thou affordeſt me that body which thou bequeathedſt to thy Mother, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thy ſpirit which thou recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendedſt to thy Father. O that any one could have applyed his mouth to that of the expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing IESVS, and gatherd thence his ſacred breath worthy to be gatherd by the hands of God that it might animate and ſteer my body! o that any one could with the effuſion of his own blood waſh the disfigured Corps of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS, and make himſelf the viol of Chriſts blood ſhed for my ſake, to cleanſe my ſoul ſo ill-favourd and ugly! o that any one would hold his mouth to receive and taſt the water &amp; blood which flowed from the ſide of Chriſt, that not ſo much as one drop of it might fall to waſt! but thou, o Lord, deſirous and deſirable complyeſt with my wiſhes in this dreadful myſtery. How great joy did the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels conceive in thy Aſcension when thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tredſt triumphant into heaven, what longing desires preceded thy return thither? o the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired of all the Hierarchyes of heavenly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, with what jubily of hart ought I to exul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I alone upon many ſcores owe thee all the reverence which all the Angels exhibited when
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:39021:191"/> they entertaind thee returning from this world and paſſible life: for thou frequently enterſt into me, that thou mayſt delight me alone, thou who once only enterd into heaven to cauſe joy to all the Angels. Thou frequently doſt for me alone what thou didſt but once for all the quyres of bleſſed ſpirits. If this favour were imparted to one alone of all the multitudes of men, that once only through all eternity Chriſt ſhould enter after this moſt amiable manner into his ſole breaſt, what a ſtupendious benefit would it be deemd? who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould hear of it, raviſhd into extaſy with this exceſs of bounty, would ſcarſe believe it: he that received him, abſorpt in admiration would ſtand like one beſides himſelf without voyce, without motion, yea without life, through amazement, fear, joy, and love, unles he were miraculouſly ſuſtaind, by reaſon of ſuch unheard-off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence: why then do not I worthily reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and admire a greater benefit conferd not once but often, not on me alone but all, wherein I acknowledg the favour done me much hightned. O that I or any one could entertain thee, o amiable IESVS, becoming my gueſt, as thy Father entertaind thee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into heaven after a world of torments and death! for the ſanctity of all the Angels, their devotion, their joy, pomp and celebrity fell far ſhort I wil not ſay of thy majeſty but even of that humility wherwith thou daigneſt to ſhut thy ſelf up in the narrow cottage of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:39021:191"/> my hart: grant me grace by ſo rare an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to humble my ſelf below nothing. I that cannot humble my ſelf ſufficiently in reſpect of thy humility, how can I do it in reſpect of thy majeſty and glory? o how happy is that ſoul that ſhal humble it ſelf before this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what honour will accrew to it? how wil the Angels reverence and honour ſuch a one, that it may receive its Lord with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour! S. Tereſa oftner then once beheld the Brothers of our Society, when they went to communicate in our Church, accompanyd with Angels and theſe holding a moſt rich and beautiful canopy, over their heads that like royal and conſecrated ſoules they might more honorably entertain their ſoveraign: but when others approachd that heavenly Table, ſhe beheld no ſuch obſequiouſnes in theſe B: Spirits; and the reaſon was want of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in their devotions. Let us then procure with all humility, devotion, fervour and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to receive that ſuperſubſtantial daily bread. Let us ſo receive it daily, as if we were never more to receive it; though we come very frequently, let us come ſo, as if it were to be but once in our whole life: Let our daily communion be ſo performd as it ought, to be the firſt day of our life and laſt at our death.</p>

                  <p>THE Angels expect thee at their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, glut not thy ſelf like a beaſt with corruptible food. He that is invited as a gueſt to anothers table eats nothing at home: thou art invited a gueſt to heaven do not at leaſt glut thy ſelf upon earth. If one that is cloyd with earthly food cannot be a competent gueſt at an earthly banquet, how can he be at a heavenly one? fulnes hinders the reliſh of material meats, how much more then of divine? the faſting Lazarus who could not ſo much as feed upon crums, is now a conſtant gueſt at the heavenly ſupper; but that glutton who cramd himſelf with exquiſit daintyes is ſhut forth. Men at a banquet abſtain from ſeveral diſhes reſerving their appetite for ſome choyſe one intending to make their repaſt upon that: o Lord, if I ſhal be ſatiated at the appearance of thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I reſerve my ſelf for it and wil refrain from theſe groſſer meats of the earth. Vpon hopes to feed more ſavourly at a wel furniſhd table, the gueſt is content to protract his faſt: it is but meet that upon hopes of the divine ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per we at leaſt keep abſtinence. Remember
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:39021:192"/> that Chriſt hath made thee equal with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and wil it not then be a ſhame to do like a beaſt? he that cannot wholly wipe off an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, leſſens and diſſembles it as much as he can; let it confound us to renew daily the brand we received by gluttony in our firſt fall from a ſtate of happines, and that with ſo much guſt and ſavour. If we had heaven eyther in eſteem or hunger, we ſhould loath earth and earthly things: where, when we are to eat, for as much as concerns guſt, we muſt carry our ſelves as if there were none at all.</p>
                  <p>God himſelf invites thee a gueſt to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of eternal glory: in the interim ſitting down to table let Chriſt be thy fellow-gueſt and thou wilt be abſtemious, if thou ſuppoſe thou art to divide with him. What ſoever thou ſubtracteſt from thy neceſſary ſuſtenance, offer it to IESVS. The Phariſees and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans invited IESVS; thou being a Chriſtian muſt not think much to do the ſame. He that invites another, labours not ſo much to pleaſe his own palat as his gueſts, for whom he carves the beſt piece: ſo when thou ſitteſt down at table, ſtrive not to content thy own relliſh, but ſtudy how to pleaſure Chriſt and the only way to pleaſe his guſt is to take no guſt at all. Conſider him where he refreſhed thoſe 3. dayes when his Mother loſt him in the Temple: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a banquet for him together with Saint Mathew. Contemplate Chriſt &amp; his diſciples when through want of neceſſaries they pulled
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:39021:193"/> cares of corne: call him &amp; making him ſhare of thy proviſions prepare him a feaſt together with Zaccheus. Behold him faſting 40. dayes for thy ſake: and if thou wilt not miniſter to him with the Angels, invite him with Simon; and he will be as much refreſhed with thy ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, as if a table were furniſhed for him by the Angels. He begd a draught of water of the Samaritan; do thou give him of thy cup. I thirſt, cryed he, from the croſs; let him taſt of thy Chalice. O that any one would give me gall &amp; vinegar, &amp; I would exchange cups with Chriſt, relieving his thirſt with my drink! how could I chuſe but relieve thee, o Lord, in ſuch extreme neceſſity? now I am able to do it, and undoubtedly thou wilt relliſh my good will and deſire of abſtinence more ſavourly then if I offerd thee a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious draught. How unnatural were he that would not relieve thee? now I may do it, if I drink not more then is neceſſary. Why ſhal I not refreſh thy thirſt? behold, o ſoul, thy IESVS deſirous to eat his Paſch with us: accompany the Apoſtles that thou maiſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of ſo deſired a table. Carry thy ſelf there with modeſty and humility: ſeek the loweſt place, but chuſe not for all that the place of Iudas. Thou art not worthy to ſit at ſuch a table; place thy ſelf at the feet of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion the betraier: the moſt humble IESVS will even there alſo find thee out. Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate how he fed ſo many yeares with his moſt H<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mother and S. Ioſeph: ſhe perchance
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:39021:193"/> ſometimes eat very ſparingly and defrauded her own mouth of many bits purpoſely to give them to her moſt loving Son their pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not ſufficing for both: deprive thy ſelf of ſome parcel &amp; give it as an almest to the Virgin wherewith to feed her deareſt child. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how this Mother of love gave ſuck to her Infant IESVS: how the Son of God even then would faſt for thy ſake, &amp; abſtain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from theſe ſweet breaſts: do thou alſo for his ſake refrain at leaſt from ſome particle, and offer it to Chriſt with a moſt ardent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, with ſuch, to wit, as ſhe nurſed him: imitate to thy utmoſt her love. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thou ſhalt ſtifle with pious meditations and foreſtail thy appetite by an affection to things divine. One deſire wil drive out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one relliſh drown another. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance gluttony wil be no les extirpated, and thy mind by ruminating what is read at table and ſuch pious employments more purged then by faſting it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>If the motive of doing a thing acceptable to Chriſt do not urge thee, the dignity of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence &amp; the profit which redounds from it ought in all reaſon to prevail. Nothing is more contrary to the ſpirit then an unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied appetite. Eat to refreſh thy body not to overcharge it. Many when they eat do rather oppreſs then nouriſh their bodies; making that which ought to be the refection of life its oppreſſion. Is it not very abſurd to load and ſtuff ones belly as one would do an aſſes pack,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:39021:194"/> ſince our fleſh is elevated above the Cherubins? if the kingdome of God and tabernacle of the H. Ghoſt be within us, why are we ſo baſe-minded as to make our ſtomacks the charnel-houſe or Sepulcher of dead beaſts? he that ought to be the Temple of the living God, cald to a divine life, why doth he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe himſelf to the meaneſt of all lives? to wit', a dead life and the very dregs of all life. Plants having only a nutritive life, are void of all ſenſe. We looſe ſo much of our mind as we beſtow of it upon meat: what more unworthy then the loſs of an Angelical life &amp; mind? if thou feedſt too greedily &amp; ſenſually, thou haſt reaſon to fear leaſt thou degenerate not ſo much into a beaſt as into a tree or a ſtock. Adam being overcome with gluttony clad himſelf with leaves like a tree, as if he meant to become one, carrying its ſhape in his flight from God. Gluttony and nutrition is not only a life proper to unreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures but to the very inſenſible plants, nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being only peculiar to them. Therfore a full belly obſtructs all ſenſe, it evacuates the mind, it diſpoſeth one to inſenſibility by hindring the uſe of reaſon which after dinner is dull and ſluggiſh, it induceth ſleep in which a man differs nothing at all from an elme or plain tree, ſave only that this at ſet times affords the benefit of a ſhade: but the life of gourmandizers is the life of ſleepers and the life of ſleepers the life of a gourd which is allwaies in a lying poſture. Hence it followes
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:39021:194"/> that he who is les abſtemious is les obſequious to reaſon, as being more inſenſible: the ſole life of trees is uncapable of command. Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition it ſelf is not in the power of a creature. When we check our deſires or curbe ſavage beaſts they become tame and pliable to their keepers: but plants which regard nothing as I may ſay but their belly, that is, to feed themſelves, they harken to no body nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard reaſon. This kind of life is the ſcum and refuſe of all lives, and moſt remote from a ſoul endowed with reaſon; how much more from a ſpirit which breaths God. A dog will hear his maſters call ſo will not an oak or fig tree the husbandmans, nor he that over feeds himſelf the voyce of God. He to keep Adam to his duty enacted the firſt law of faſting, &amp; the only one of that moſt happy ſtate; ſo to recommend more earneſtly to us the vertue of abſtinence, as if it alone were ſufficient to preſerve innocency and other vertuous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, putting man in a fit diſpoſition to hear and adhere to God. Our Lord would commit the tuition of his beloved child Adam and his Benjamin of creatures to no nurſe but faſting; into whoſe faithfull hands he entruſted him, that it might be the foſter-Father of man and his inſtructer to obedience. But this precept being violated Adam forth with fled from the voice of God, caring ſo little to adhere to him that he would not only not ſeek nor approach him but ſought to avoid God who ſought him. He renders
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:39021:195"/> himſelf wholly unfit for all who is not abſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious: he will reſiſt Gods holy inſpirations and withdraw himſelf from his familiarity, being weand as much from the divine breaſts as he yealds to theſe ſenſual appetites.</p>
                  <p>What commerce betwixt God and ones belly? how can God affect him who affects only his gut as his God? How canſt thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, o divine truth, to dwel in him who is ſuch an arrand idolater? it was anciently held a high ſtrain of folly for men to kneel by way of worſhip to thoſe things that were the handy-work of men: and how fond a thing is it for thee an intemperate man to ſet thy hart upon that which thou deſtroieſt and wil deſtroy thee, towitt, meat and its relliſh. How intendeſt thou to feaſt with God, to lead a celeſtial kind of life, to fly with him upon the wings of the winds to immortality; if thou takeſt complacence in the life of thoſe things which ſtick to the earth, and are rooted and half-buried in it. The life of ſelf-pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perers is extremely mortal: for ſuch is the life of plants which are in part overwhelmed with earth. Thoſe that feed their belly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their mortality by fatning what is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in them, becoming more mortal by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering eternal life, by defiling their mind, and ſo contracting their ſoul as to render it only corporeal. Adam by breaking his faſt became forthwith mortal: thou becomeſt every day more mortal by ſtuffing thy ſelf with dead things, and feeding greedily on
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:39021:195"/> ſlaughterd creatures, and ſeaſond for this end that they may be entombed in thee: but ſo much more happy ſhalt thou be by how much thou partakeſt of immortality; and thou ſhalt partake ſo much the more of it, if thou inure thy ſelf to a ſpare dyet and to feed on unſavory meats. All our life in this world is bitter, full of labour and afflictions: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is impertinent to go about to repayr &amp; maintain it with ſweet things. Eat only that thou mayſt live: let thy meat be ſuch as is the reſt of thy life. Thou liveſt not to eat, but to dye; and thou eateſt that thou mayſt not dye quickly. Death aſſailes him ſooner that feeds too plentifully and delicately. Food muſt be the medicine of life not its poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Let thy own hunger and the gall and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Chriſt be all thy ſauce and ſeaſoning: who for that end drunk it upon the croſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whoſoever combats againſt ſin muſt not ſeek after ſavory meats: and the adjoyning of hyſſop with a ſpunge ſignifyes the vertue of cleanſing, that we might have a model how to purge our ſoules. By frugality and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toothſome meat, the divine character which is engraven in us becomes more reſplendent and the holy purity of our mind is refind, that it may be united to God, &amp; made more capable of divine impreſſions: for if faſting drive out the ſtubborneſt dive is from anothers body, much more forcibly wil it attract God ſo facil and benign into our own. If ſuch be
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:39021:196"/> the vertue of faſting that by it thou canſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify others; much more wil it ſanctify thy ſelf. He breaths ſomewhat divine who breaths abſtinence and hunger: the body it ſelf is in a certain manner elevated by the force of a diſengagd ſpirit. Iron is ponderous; but it becomes light by the ſpirit and vertue of the loadſtone: and if thou alſo faſten and hang thy ſelf upon God he wil ſublimate thy body by the vigour of thy ſpirit rendring it intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual and incorporeal. The compoſition alſo of thy body is rarefyed by abſtinence, in ſuch ſort that divine irradiations penetrate more eaſily into the ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhe more dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly ſteers the other ſquard more fitly to it by a proportionable demoliſhment, as being disbarked of that fat rind that environd it; for a great weight is no wayes weildy or commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly mannageable.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly abſtinence containes ſo great a good that there is nothing to which it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme beneficial. Other vertues adorne the ſoul, but abſtinence is ſalutiferous both to body and ſoul. Both Saints &amp; Philoſophers by embracing it protracted their life to a faire old age. We men deſignd to be immortal had contented our ſelves in that moſt happy ſtate of innocency to feed only upon hearbs &amp; the fruits of the earth: now temperance alſo reſtores to man that golden age. Spare diet conduceth to the health of the body, it is a natural reſtaurative, an univerſal medecine fit to be applyed to al kinds of diſeaſes. The
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:39021:196"/> skilfulleſt Phyſitians preſcribe it for the firſt recipe in all maladies: for oppletion is the metropolis or head-city of diſeaſes and deaths chief ſergeant. All the untimely deaths of yong people are in a manner cauſed by exceſs in diet. But if frugality be effectual againſt all the indiſpoſitions of the body, it wil alſo give redreſs to thoſe of the ſoul. Hunger makes the proud to ſtoop, the covetous to disburſe, the lazy &amp; ſlouthful it forceth to work; it renders the luxurious chaſt &amp; the angry man calmely patient. If then frugality even when it is forced, makes head againſt all vices; if when it is no vertue it can engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vertues; what remaines, when it is a true and ſincere one, but that muſt needs aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate God to a ſoul and make him its conſtant ſejourner. God took complacence in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with Moyſes and Elias when they were both in a long faſt.</p>
                  <p>But after the ſame manner that it expels &amp; puts the divels to flight, ſaturity bereaves us of God. Vnles thou reſolve to baniſh this vice and eſtabliſh in thy ſoul the vertue of temperance, thou maiſt wel diſpaire of the reſt. It wil be the ſame as if one being deſirous to beat away a troubleſome dog ſhould in ſteed of a ſtone throw at him a cruſt of bread. A domeſtique enemy muſt firſt be vanquiſhd, ere, we can fal abord with a foraign.</p>

The commonwelth without magiſtrates wil become the mere ſink of villany; a field untild, a nurſery of brambles. The ſin of Adam corrupted our heart more then it did the earth.

The ſole wiſe man is rich: happy is he who is maſter of himſelf acknowledging his own vilenes, and makes that his ſearch, and comes as it were to finger it. One loves to know the horſe he is to ride on, one wil have the number of his cattle and ſheep, and is content to be only ignorant of himſelf, and ſin without number. Why wil man be ſuch a great enemy to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as not to regard himſelf? but if thou wilt hate thy ſelf to thy advantage, do it, I pray, by abhorring thy ſelf not by forgetting.

Next conſider Chriſt judging with all ſeverity the reſt of mankind, and pronouncing the concluding ſentence of damnation: beholding him on the other ſide crucifyed for thy ſake, and thy ſelf alone buſy in diſcuſſing thy ſelf at his feet on Mount Calvary together with the Mother of IESVS, Iohn, and Magdalen melting into teares, even the beloved IESVS himſelf weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and crying, father forgive him for he knowes not what he doth. Employd in the ſelf-ſame thoughts come to thy Confeſſors feet in full hope of pardon if thou be not too indulgent in pardoning thy ſelf; conſidering thy IESVS little regarding thy ſins and their puniſhment, and only ſollicitous to ſign thy pardon, laying aſide all thought of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and greatnes, as being only deſirous to ſhew favour and indulgence, becauſe he had committed to thy care and truſt a diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into them and a due revenge by way of ſatisfaction.

It fares not with our conſcience as it doth with our countenance; we ſee other mens faces not our own, but we behold our own conſcience not anothers: wherfore we ought and are only able to judg and condemn our ſelves. If thou thy ſelf who art only able to diſcerne thy own conſcience findſt it a difficult buſines to paſs verdict upon many of thy actions whether they be good or bad, whether thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven conſent or no; how dareſt thou judg others, whoſe harts are unfolded to none but God? If thou canſt not diſcover thy own mind, why doſt thou judge of anothers? if thou art unable to diſcern thy own, how dareſt thou paſs ſentence upon thy neighbours? If thou weigheſt not thy own proceedings, why doſt thou draw others into thy ballance? but for the moſt part thoſe that ſtand idle in the market-place are the people which buſy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:39021:201"/> in murmuring and ſlandering others: ſo he that neglects his own ſoul ſpends his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure more freely upon his neighbours. We might long ago have learnd by experience how lyable our judgments are to errour. Even in corporal things and thoſe which have but an extrinſecal appearance and colour, our ſenſes are very frequently deluded; how much more obvious is it to err in judging the harts of men, of which they have no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivance at all, whoſe motions are ſwaid by free will, and in which Gods grace works ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſo many miracles. Although one ſeem to have clear arguments to ground a ſiniſtrous ſuſpicion, yet one ought not to judge ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly, becauſe he may eaſily judge amiſs. While the companions of S. Boniface were buſy in his ſearch, they ſuſpected not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground according to the tenour of his former behaviour that he was in the company of ſome lewd harlot: but he in the meane time burning with a far different flame of the love of God, was ſuffering cruel torments for the faith of Chriſt. So fallacious was a probable judgment: how much then wilt thou miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in thy groundles and improbable ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? he that is in ſuperiority over another, and is by office to judge, muſt not condemn him, unles he prove evidently faulty; in things doubtful the criminal is abſolved: how dareſt thou of thy own uncertain and erroneous brain condemn him who is better then thy ſelf, &amp; by whom thou art to be judged?</p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:39021:201"/>

Chriſt being to judge mankind, he himſelf became man, and veſted himſelf with our nature: and thou alſo if thou wilt judg or reprehend another muſt put on his perſon, and proceed with him as thou wouldſt be proceeded with all. Let this be the firſt feat of thy charity not to be ſcandalized or offended with thy brother; the ſecond not to offend him; the third to help and aſſiſt him in what thou art able; nevertheles becauſe thy love is but lukewarm thou art often defective in thy duty, and takeſt offence unjuſtly even at the innocent, diſdaining them many times that are acceptable to God. Where is thy charity towards him, where is thy love to IESVS, if thoſe be a diſpleaſing eye ſore to thee who are ſo pleaſing to him, ſo deep in his favour, and do him better ſervice then thou a ſinner? if thou lovedſt God and his immenſe goodnes, thou wouldſt love all for his goodnes; the good becauſe they are good, the bad becauſe they may be good. Not only an elaborate piece of workmanſhip, but the very materials of which it is made are had in no ſmal requeſt. Of evill many become good, we muſt not diſdain them: this is to love all for goodnes:
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:39021:202"/> this is to love all in God when we love for that which cannot be loved without God, as goodnes, juſtice vertue and the like.</p>
                  <p>If thou didſt love the goodnes of God thou wouldſt love all in God, and covet that all loved him, and wouldſt put to a helping hand and be ſollicitous in this behalf. Of a much different ſtrain is the zeal of humane and divine love. Humane goodnes is finite and narrow bounded not ſuffiſing for all, nay not even for many but les wil fall to each ones ſhare: &amp; therfore men endeavour what they can that none els love whats dear to them: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the goodnes of God is infinite and more then abundantly ſufficient for all, and our love of ſuch a limited condition that it cannot correſpond to ſo great goodnes; therfore Gods deſire is that each one love it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our love, and cooperate towards it, to the end they may diſcharg and ſatisfy for that goodnes which we are not able with any love of ours to equalize. Thou loveſt God imprudently, unles thy deſire be that all love him; for thou muſt love him more then thy ſelf, &amp; thy deſire is that all love thee though thou be ſo very bad; why are thy wiſhes on Gods behalf more barren and bounded, he being ſo extremely good?</p>
                  <p>O infinite goodnes of God, who loved me ſo much the meaneſt and very outcaſt of ſinners, that being not content to love me, thou wouldſt moreover that all ſhould love me, and commanded it too; why ſhal not I
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:39021:202"/> covet that all love thee and procure it to the utmoſt of my power? yea thou haſt obliged all by thy precept &amp; blood, that they ſhould love me no leſs then thou lovedſt me, and every one loves himſelf. Give me grace, that I alſo may obſerve theſe examples of love that I may love all. Thou ſaidſt; this is my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that you love one another as I loved you. And again; thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf. Thou, o Lord, lovedſt me eer I loved thee; thou, o Lord, lovedſt me not for any commodity redounding to thee but to me: thou lovedſt me with an immenſe love, for none hath greater charity then this that one give his ſoul for his friends: thou didſt love me with a perſeverant love: thou art he who when he loved his who were in the world he loved them to the end. Theſe are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions with which thou lovedſt me, and muſt be the rule conformably to which I muſt love others. O my ſoul, learn love from the love of Chriſt, &amp; love them as thy own life whom Chriſt loved more then his, and wil in then be loved and worſhipd.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt lay ſick in bed (thou wilt not deem it indecency that he be ſuppoſed lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing for our good, who for our ſalvation took really upon him our languours) or pinchd with hunger; and ſome other poor body lay alſo ſick in another bed and were preſſed with the ſame want; and thou ſhouldſt demand of Chriſt whether of the two he would have thee to relieve firſt, himſelf or
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:39021:203"/> that other party; I believe he would piouſly anſwere, that other: for Chriſt himſelf would defraud his own mouth of meat to aſſwage a poor mans hunger. Serve then and reverence Chriſt in ſuch a one: if thou canſt not do it in fact, do it at leaſt by prayer and compaſſion; not only in corporal neceſſities but much more in ſpiritual. God prizeth ſo highly an almes beſtowd on the body, that he promiſeth heaven for its reward, nor aſſignes any other cauſe of acquitting them in the dreadful day of doom; how much more wil he eſteem an almes beſtowd on the ſoul, for which he daignd to dye? o the infinit charity of God, o moſt loving Saviour who gaveſt thy ſoul for ſinners, grant that I may love their ſoules as thou lovedſt them. I wil take a pattern from thy love to know how I am to love thoſe whom thou lovedſt and not from my own; neyther wil I love my neighbour as I loved my ſelf for then I ſhal love him but untowardly. I knew not how to love my ſelf, how can I love others. How could I love my ſelf who loved my own wil, who loved iniquity? but I wil love my neighbour as I ought to love my ſelf, deſiring thy wil may be accompliſhd in him, and he more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enrichd with thy grace; that all may ſerve thee moſt fervently, and adore thee in ſpirit and truth.</p>

O God, how am I engulphd in an Ocean of thy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence! whatſoever thou doſt is a benefit, yea and my peculiar benefit. The actuations and productions of light are light: &amp; a light that is expoſd for one mans direction, illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates all that ſtand about him: ſo doſt thou, o light of truth, o nature of goodnes; and therfore becauſe thou art beneficial, thou canſt do nothing which is not beneficial: and it is neceſſarily conſequent that the benefit thou beſtoweſt upon one is not only proficu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him but all. Each beſt guift and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect bleſſing is deſcending from above from the Father of lights; becauſe thou diffuſeſt them like unto the diffuſions of light, thou communicating thy ſelf to all and for all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any decreaſe or impoveriſhment. A light remaining ſtill intyre divides its beames to all, and another, without any prejudice to it, may borrow ſome from its flame. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſun darts forth is light; all may ſee by meanes of it, unles they wilfully ſeale up their eyes. All the effects which God produceth are ſo many benefits; and by them each one may help and profit himſelf, unles he wil be fooliſh and perverſe. Thy ardent love doth alwayes, o Lord, accompany thy guifts as heat doth light: this is an immenſe priviledge conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:39021:207"/> to them, that they are ſo many pawns and pledges of thy love: although this be not patent to the eye, yet it diſcovers it ſelf in the benefical effect. For though we ſee only the light which the ſun communicates not the heat, yet this doth ſtill attend the other.</p>
                  <p>O Father of lights what thanks am I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to thee for the univerſity of thy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits conferd upon all, thoſe credentials of thy love, which love I chiefly embrace and adore in thy works! who wil not ſtand amazd at the inventivenes of thy goodnes, making the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all, the benefit of each one, and the benefit of each one the benefit of all, private ones publick &amp; publick private? all the works of nature, all the wonders of grace, all the predeſtinate, all the bleſſed are my benefits: all the proſperity, all the calamityes that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall man, are ſo many favours which thou lovingly beſtoweſt upon me. O ungrateful man, wouldſt thou not love God with the whole impetuoſity of thy hart, if he ſhould exempt thee from damnation, thou carrying the guilt of hell fire by dying in ſome dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſin; but ſhould create another much better then thee, deputing him in thy place to ſuffer for thee that hell of torments? God did much more then this: I omit that he fatherd our faults upon himſelf daigning to dye for our ſake; this now amazeth me, although it be incomparably leſs, that he would ſhut the gates of mercy againſt many &amp; ſentence them to damnation to ſave thee: for if thou didſt
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:39021:207"/> ſee but few condemned, thy fear would be much leſs &amp; thou perchance thy ſelf make one in that heap: if two onely or three; thy fear would yet be more leſſend, and thou mighteſt preſume with more certainty, one of them would be thy ſelf: if none at all; thy fear would be none; and mayſt wel think that thou alone wouldſt incur that miſery; or which is worſe be much more frequent in ſinning and leſs obſervant towards God. Therfore the torment and damnation of ſo many ſoules is to me a great benefit. O light of my hart, with how bright beames doth thy love ſhine towards thy elect! thou madeſt other creature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels become ſervants to men, yea thou thy ſelf being made man: what if thou wouldſt have one man ſerve another? If for ſome reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of temporal life thou permitteſt man to ſerve man, and a ſlave his maſter: for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of eternal life and increaſe of glory a reprobate muſt ſerve an elect.

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:39021:208"/> but hath ſome mixture of divine juſtice, which is very ſavory. God is ſo bountifully good, ſuch a skilful Alchymiſt, that he turnes droſs into gold, that is, our very miſeries into mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and which is yet more, out of the worſt minerals of ſinfulnes, they alone being only bad, he extracts pretious mettals, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even the moſt pretious. Thou, o Lord, conferreſt thy benefits with ſuch a ſtrong and open hand, that even from ſin, where thou haſt neyther power nor activity (thou being both impotent to act in it or concur to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers acting) thou both draweſt and art able to draw great good. Thy skil knowes how to extract immenſe bleſsings and vertues out of ſin. Light reverberating upon a condenſe and obſcure body uncapable of its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is ſo far from being eclipſed that it dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles it ſelf by reflection: neyther is thy beneficence ever defeated or renderd ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. Out of ſin, where nothing is but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly bad, thou rectifyeſt all to my good, decreeing thence thy beloved ſons In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation. As well from my own ſins as thoſe of others, thou knoweſt how to take an occaſion of being beneficial on my behalf: when I hear of a crime committed by another, I am ſorry for the misfortune of my brother, but take an occaſion thence of thanking thee, becauſe I hope for mercy at thy hands eyther for him or me. I yeald thee thanks becauſe thou wilt derive thence no ſmal good to me, unles I wil become quite blind and ſhut my eyes againſt the light.</p>

                  <p> Sing prayſe once more o my ſoul to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights, and be not forgetful of all his retributions: for they all are his guifts, even thoſe that ſeem to flow from men, and thou receiveſt immediately from them: for if thou muſt perſwade thy ſelf that all the croſs ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grievances which befall thee from men, come from God, why wilt thou not alſo be of the ſame mind concerning good, his nature being goodnes it ſelf, and he ſo prone to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it? all the light which beautifies the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens though ſome little ſtar or the moon by night do dart it forth, proceeds from the ſun though he the Author be not ſeen: in like manner each bleſſing &amp; benefit though receivd from man, flowes from God, and is but a ray of his goodnes. This is the main comfort which ſuſtaines mans life amidſt ſuch a world of miſeries as attend it, that nothing can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen but by Gods permiſsion; and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he permits can be no other then a benefit according to the nature of his goodnes: and what benefit ſoever befalls us proceeds from him, and whatſoever proceeds from him is my benefit, and orderd to me and my good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Corporal afflictions and the miſeries of this life, whether I or any other tolerate them general dearths, diſeaſes, peſtilences, all theſe are my benefits, o Lord, thou afflicting others for my good.

O immenſe beneficence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of love to which the divine omnipotency ſubmitted and yealded it ſelf as it were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come! thou haſt gone beyond all the ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems of God, and put a ſtint to theſe his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and unlimited deſires; why doſt thou not
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:39021:209"/> make uſe of my infirmity, ſuſpend my thoughts, bounding my deſires in ſuch ſort, that I may endeavour, think, and wiſh nothing beſides thee? we thy children, o Lord, whom thou haſt nurturd up by creation, diſpiſed thee; how can we, whom thou haſt honoured and exalted even to be ſharers of thy majeſty, how can we I ſay, contemn and rather not love thee who for love of us vilified thy ſelf ſo far as to partake of our vilenes? o Lord, how comfortable is this benefit of our redemption to me, when I behold thee groaning under a heavy burthen of afflictions, joynt-ſufferer in our miſeries and all this out of mere love and affection to us: couldſt not thou contrive ſome other meanes of redeeming us with leſs lyablenes to the rigour of juſtice? couldſt not thou have created ſome nobly-qualifyed Angel who might undergo at leaſt the paines of hel? yea couldſt not thou thy ſelf, even complying with the ſtrict tenour of juſtice have accompliſhd it without ſuch a world of torments? but thou didſt it to take up and poſſeſs the whole extent of our love. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance if our redeemer had been different from our Creator, that is, one redeemd us another created us, we ſhould have had more love for our Redeemer then Creator, and for that reaſon thou wouldſt be both the one and other, ſo to become the object of all our love and that this thy love might be more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous thou didſt not ayme at a bare ſufficiency or equality, but at an over-abundance and
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:39021:210"/> inundation; that in ſuch a boundles ſea we might ſee thy love which knowes no bound.</p>
                  <p>Thou who madeſt all things in number weight, and meaſure, thou who being Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of nature rejecteſt ſuperfluities, why wouldſt thou, as it were, confound all in thy redemption? tranſported beſides thy ſelf and thy ordinary manner of proceeding thou obſervedſt no number of torments, no weight of thy pretious blood, no meaſure of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſatisfaction; but in an overmeaſure of thy ſufferings thou gaveſt us a ſuperabundant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption meaſuring out all without any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at all. Surely the reaſon was becauſe an immenſe love was chief Architect in ſo great a work, in which work thou intendedſt to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy love conſpicuouſly viſible, we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are ſo incredulous, not believing it out of other thy feats &amp; benefits. But though thou proceededſt with ſuch a loving extravagancy, thou art not changed from thy former princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, &amp; what thou waſt before: thou keepeſt proportion in all thy works, and here alſo didſt thou obſerve a meane, but it was to do all without meane, becauſe thy love is ſo, &amp; otherwiſe there would be no exact equality. In like manner I behold here, thy infinity, for as much as thou carryeſt thy ſelf without any reſtriction or proportion at all. This benefit forceth love from me, becauſe it convinceth thee to be a lover: out of thy other benefits I conjecture thee to love, in this I ſee it. The reſt hinder not but that one may judge them
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:39021:210"/> to proceed from ſome other motive then love; of this none can ſuſpect other but that it is done with immenſe love. Although the reſt excluded love, nothing would be derogated from thy majeſty, nor the divine honour ſuffer detriment: here would be a defect of congruency, if we regard the autority of the divinity, ſuppoſing they ſhould flow from any other fountain. The reſt though done without love, would yet be worthy of prayſe and reverence: but this, if love interceded not, would ſeem an eye-ſore, I wil not ſay in God, but even in man, &amp; a thing worthy of diſpraiſe and contempt. But becauſe it implies an impoſſibility that thou do any thing leſs beſeeming thy ſelf, I am aſcertaind beyond all peradventure that thou loveſt me. It would be deemd a kingly buſines to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, uphold, enrich, and be each way beneficial even to thoſe who deſerved no love; this, I ſay, would well become the higheſt majeſty: but if a great monarck ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe himſelf to mean drudgeries, ſhould conſort with ſcullions &amp; cooks &amp; the grooms of his ſtable, and dreſsing himſelf in their liveries ſhould ſit at their table; who would not ſleight him, and account him no better then a mad man? nothing could be pretended for his excuſe but that he were tranſported with love, &amp; yealded for a time to this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, ſo to work upon the affection of the party beloved, or uſed it as a ſtratagem to bring his deſires to a happy iſſue. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:39021:211"/> themſelves confeſs loue to be ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged, that it can never be blemiſhed with infamy, yea that it wipes of all theſe ſtaines which if contracted without love, would be held undecent and ugly: but love turns them all into merit, and transformes infamy into glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou, o Lord, canſt do nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming thy divinity: wherfore whatſoever thou didſt by evacuating thy autority and ſtooping to the condition of an abject crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all was done out of love to me.</p>
                  <p>Lock up in thy hart, o my ſoul, this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious pledg of divine love, divine humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; which by loves prerogative is the higheſt glory. Love excuſeth the majeſty of God, the ſame exalteth the humility of God. This love forceth a reciprocal love from me: fire enkindles fire, and love provokes to love: let thy love, o Lord, enflame me with love of thee; thou who cameſt to ſend this fire: but couldſt thou not, o Lord, ſend it without coming thy ſelf, and becoming Incarnate? why was it neceſſary that thou ſhouldſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man to enflame men? was it becauſe fire doth not operate but upon an approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated ſubject? for fire in the purity of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and in its element is ſayd not to be active nor enkindle any ſolid matter; but it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that it be in a foraign ſubject &amp; renderd viſible: ſo thou o Lord though in the refindnes of thy pureſt nature thou be love and a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire, yet thou didſt not enflame man but by becoming man: like as elementary fire is
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:39021:211"/> not active upon wood unles it be firſt enkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in wood or ſome other matter more groſs and condenſe then is the firmament: as then it wil enkindle other wood, it becoming a conſpicuous and viſible flame. Thy viſible love, thou being made man, cannot but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame and ſet man all on fire.</p>
                  <p>That benefit is much heightned which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates all intreaty, and is conferd without any interceſſion: and much more if it come unhoped for or unexpected; for bleſsings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookd for affect one more feelingly, &amp; moſt of all if they prevent all wiſhes and deſires: for nothing befalls us more agreeably and to our harts-content, then what is given without the expenſe of ſo much as a wiſh: now what muſt that needs be which foreſtals all kind of expectancy: what wil that be which could not ſo much as enter into our thought? ſuch a one is this benefit and unexpected Sacrament of our redemption, which if any one, before it was intimated to us, had begd to be done after the manner it is done, his prayers would have been thought blaſphemy, his hope a mad raſhnes, his wiſh a ſacrilegious wil, his fancy impiety. An unexpected guift is moſt grateful: what wil that be which was never ſo much as conceyted? thy beneficence indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently granted what our indigency fancyd impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>But above all, the frontiſpice and inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love which this benefit carryes engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (that being the prizer and taxer of guifts)
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:39021:212"/> doth moſt affect me: all guifts are teſtimonials and credentials of love; what more credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then this? Guifts are not rated according to their bulk, but the remonſtrance of love that accompanies them. This is an immenſe favour, which that it may ſtand in the rank of benefits not of diſgraces, it carryes in its front in capital letters the immenſe love of God. O Lord, if I be endebted to thee whatſoever I am for my creation, what ſhal I owe thee for thy love? I acknowledg my ſelf to owe more then my ſelf, yea as much more as thy greatnes exceeds my nothing, thou who gaveſt thy ſelf to me in thy nativity, in thy life, in thy death, in thy reſurrection, and laſtly in that ſacred banquet of thy moſt holy body. Effect, that whatſoever was thine by creation, and thou repairedſt by redemption, I may make it all thine by love. I were not able to make condigne recompenſe for the leaſt of thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, though by way of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ksgiving I ſhould endure all the paines of hell for all eternity; the reaſon is becauſe it proceeds from the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thy love, which infinitly exceeds any infinity of recompenſe from creatures: what then ſhal I be able to do for ſo many &amp; thoſe ſo ſignal, and chiefly for this in which thy boundles charity reflects more perſpicuouſly then do the ſun-beames.</p>

                  <p>God is ſo good and beautiful in himſelf, that though he had not made us the object of his love nor the ſubject of his beneficence, nor the iſſue of his creation, yet he were to beloved above all lovers, benefactours, and Creators whatſoever; yea although he ſhould hate us and be injurious on our behalf; for that bottomles Ocean of goodnes &amp; beauty would expiate any injury whatſoever, and much more effectually then doth beneficence. If God had beheld thee hereto fore as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of hatred, and being at enmity had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and ſought revenge, wouldſt thou not pardon and even love him, he making ſo large ſatisfaction by ſo many benefits, ſo far as not to ſpare his own ſon but give him up to death
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:39021:213"/> ſuffering a privation of that, the abſence whereof cauſeth the greateſt grief: one muſt pardon an injury in him who is beneficial; for the force of a benefit ought to extinguiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and anger: but Gods previous merits being ſo great, he deſerves more then pardon. If then his beneficence would ſuffice to clear him of alinjuriouſnes; much more would his goodnes the cauſe of beneficence, it being more noble, and ſufficiently effectual to make amends for all loſſes and injuries ſuſtaind by him. Gods goodnes is greater then his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence becauſe this flowes from that; and effects rather fall ſhort of their cauſe then otherwiſe. One ſaid of an ill deſerving man; I have receivd no good from thee but much harm, and yet for all that I cannot but love thee. O true goodnes, let me rather ſay of thee then thy image of clay: I cannot but love thee although I ſhould receive no good from thee but much evil: what then ſhal I ſay now when thou loveſt me without meane and art beneficial above meaſure.</p>
                  <p>We ſometimes love men whom we never ſaw nor heard off, nor they us, nor do they rank us in the legend of their love; but we affect them merely for the report of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty: we could take content in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, rejoyce at their ſight and honour the very memory of them: &amp; can the goodnes of God be unworthy of that which a mere humane goodnes claymes as its due?

                  <p>A very forcible motive alſo to make us love God is becauſe he is of a loving nature.

O Lord with how good title doth my ingratitude and thy pardon exact my love! but if this alone be not weighty enough to ſway the ballance, add to it that he is our Father, our benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, yea and beneficial towards all: how much am I bound to love thee, whoſe merits on my behalf are innumerable, and love boundles.</p>
                  <p>But theſe impulſives are not the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, though they be ſevere exacters of my love: I am much more engaged to love thee for thy ſole benevolence wherewith thou loveſt me then for all thy other benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: for that is the ſource of them all, and conſequently more to be prizd: and thy love is ſo far from being exhauſted, that it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible enough, if need were, to redouble thy benefits and multiply them without ſtint, if they which already abound, ſuffiſed not for my ſalvation. Thy love is equivalent not only to thy benefits already conferd, but even to thoſe in poſsibility, if any greater be poſsible, and comprizeth them all in it ſelf; yea if we may uſe the manner of ſpeech, even impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ones: for true love is not confind to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of a real power but imaginary wiſhes;

                  <p>There is yet another more pregnant cauſe of loving him then all the precedent: for if we owe him more love for his love to us then for his benefits, becauſe theſe are only its iſſue and ſo many ſparks leaping from that glowing furnace of divine charity: much more muſt we love him for his goodnes, this being the cauſe of love. How great muſt that goodnes be which is mother of ſo numerous a progeny of loves, and the ſtock from whence ſprout ſo many benefits! yea we owe not only incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible love to the divine goodnes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affection he beares us, but much greater on our parts, for the love he would bear us, if we would but diſpoſe our ſelves better and become leſs ungrateful, and conſequently more capable of a more ample charity.

I am afraid, o Lord, leaſt while I go thus to work to prayſe thy goodnes, I may be thought to jeer and deride. Would not one that took upon him to ſet forth in magnifying words the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Salomon: be judged to ſcof if he ſhould ſay; ſo great is the wiſdome of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that the lame-handed can not deſcribe it, nor the dumb utter it, nor the diſtracted make a true eſtimate of its greatnes? if this commendatory be thought deriſion theſe other compariſons in reſpect of thy goodnes are much les to the purpoſe, in order to whoſe expreſsion each creature is lame, dumb, and ſenſleſly fooliſh. O Lord, my deſire is to love thee in the ſimplicity of my ignorance; &amp; I will brook it patiently if I do not clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how thou art, which is not poſsible for me to do in this life: and although I can conceive nothing worthy of thy goodnes, for

Although all the leaves of the trees and piles of graſs, all the ſands of the ſea and motes of the ſun were all harts, yea although they were ſo many wils of burning Seraphins; yea further, though all theſe and all other poſsible creatures were each one a Hierarchy of Seraphins whoſe love at each inſtant redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled it ſelf through all eternity, all this love of them all would be as nothing in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of thy goodnes, nay it would bluſh to appear in its preſence, neyther is my meaning that it would love thee congruouſly for the whole extent of thy goodnes, but not ſo much as for thy ſole patience wherewith thou tolerateſt me, not only while I ſo heynouſly offend thee, but am ſo defectuouſly languid and remiſs in loving thee ſo great a good.</p>

                  <p>How great is that good, whoſe greatnes made it an unſeemly thing in God to be libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but was to expect the additional worth of vertue and our ſervices, though they alſo be divine benefits.

Good God! how vaſtly great muſt that good needs be, which obſtructs by its greatnes the full current of the divine beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity, and requires our endeavour and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:39021:218"/> And God ſels it at a dear rate, though he love otherwiſe to give all gratis: he ſold it to S. Laurence for a broyling, to S. Paul for the price of his head, to S.

Yea that he might ſell it us ſo dear, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would buy it at an intolerable rate, to wit, his own death and the ignominy of the croſs. God was pleaſed to beſtow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his other benefits to make us covet and acquire this; how great muſt that needs be for the coveting wherof his guifts &amp; deeds were ſo ſtupendious? and yet for all this our harts dilate not themſelves ſufficiently, nor are raiſed to a congruous ſtrain of deſire. If God attempted ſo many meanes to make us covet it; what ought we not to attempt to enjoy it? if God did and ſufferd ſo great things to legitimate us to a true title of ſuch a guift, what ought we to do and ſuffer to enter upon it? it is plain non-ſenſe to perſwade our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves that we can attain glory without labour, ſince God laboured ſo much to be able to give it. Notwithſtanding all this we incur here a double delinquency in this guift more then in others; being lyable both to ingratitude, and an action of contempt; for as much as we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour not to acquire that for the acquiring wherof God was at ſuch expenſe, yea ſteerd to that end all his actions. For his other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits we are ungrateful, for this comtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, while we purſue it not with all the cagernes of our hart and ſpirit, but prefer a

                  <p> What a tedious journey under took the queen of Saba for no other end but to enjoy the ſight of Salomon; her intention aymed not at any long ſtay, but to return preſently to her country? many come from remote lands to behold a man whom fame hath cryed up for ſome rare talents of wit or art: &amp; with how much more reaſon ought we be content to employ before hand prolix endeavours, to be able but once to contemplate God in the height of his majeſty? if permiſsion were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all of making our journey to heaven on foot, and nothing elſe were prerequired but only a pilgrimage of a thouſand yeares, no body I believe would decline the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. Thy journey thither is much more compendious; thou needſt not lift thy foot over thy threſhold nor out of thy bed; and why dare we not aſpire with all our might to compaſs a good which is ſo nigh us? the ſole luſtre of gold or flaſhings of a gem are able to make men brook the roughnes and danger of the ſeas; and the clarity of God ſtrikes us no more then if we were inſenſible, neyther do we prize an invaluable good at ſo much as the value of a little labour. But what do I inſiſt upon eternity? although glory were not eternal but momentary, yet it is a good ſo boundleſly great, that an eternity of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſhould not be deemd too much to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it but for a moment, we beholding God intuitively in that inſtant.</p>

If Gods manufactures as the heavens, the motions of the ſtars, the nature of beaſts, orderd onely for the uſe of man be to us ſuch an object of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; what will that be which he exhibits to the oſtentation of his majeſty? if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the artifice of an eye though in a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome creature or carriage-beaſt, what wil that be which eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor can enter into the hart of man? if he hath made the fabrick of this world which is but the cottage of miſerable Adam, a bridewel of ſinners, acave of brute beaſts, of ſuch an admirable ſtructure, that heathens at its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation were rapt into extaſy, what ſhal we think of his own royal Pallace? as much as a naſty ſtable falls ſhort of the court of ſome great Monarch, which is adornd with guilded roofs, paved with pretious ſtones, hung with moſt rich tapiſtry; yea as much as the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of the heavens exceeds the horrour of a ſtinking priſon; ſo much &amp; far more muſt thou imagin the dwelling place of the bleſſed to ſurpaſs the beauty of this univerſe, which reſpectively will be found but an object of loathſomenes. All the comelines of this world falls ſo far ſhort of the ſeat of the bleſſed,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:39021:220"/> that all this artifice, which the Philoſophers admired with ſo much aſtoniſhment, is in reſpect of it but an eye ſore and blemiſh of deformity.

In the guifts of nature God carried himſelf maſter-like, he made them all with a commanding word; but in his glory he reſembles an induſtrious ſervant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to and fro, ſeeking as it were to give content. If the beauty of this viſible world where he was not ſo ſollicitous to pleaſe, be ſo winning and enamouring; how much more pleaſing wil he be in that, where he made it his task &amp; ſtudy to pleaſe. The whole machin of the world was no more chargable to him then the expenſe of one voyce; he made it with a word: but glory made him as it were ſet his wits on work, and as obſequious as a ſervant, yea moſt patiently to brook diſgraces, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and death it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>If thou ſhouldſt beſtow a hundred yeares in ſpeculating the greatnes of glory &amp; ſhouldſt frame ſome high conceit of its worth, thou mightſt wel deem all to be nothing and thy conceptions to fall ſo far ſhort of compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending it, that thou canſt not ſo much as conjecture thy ſelf to have come nigh it. But in that imperfect idea which thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, rayſe thy ſelf to the gates of heaven &amp;
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:39021:221"/> beholding it open, take as clear and exact a view of it as thou canſt; that being done, caſt thy eyes upon the earth and what is remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable in its rarities: compare then the goods of both together, and ſee whether earthly things wil abide the teſt. Wonder then at ſo many unfortunate endeavours of men in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing a little worldly pelf or rather nothing, and their trewantly ſluggiſhnes in ſeeking after the true good.

He eſteems it the worſt of evils to dye, and it is a great good, without which we ſhal never arrive to the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all good. Thou doſt very fondly, o man, in declining death which is indeclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not declining tepidity and faultines which may be declind. For death hath no evil it which life gave not: the ſin of Adam cauſed in death, but was not ſo powerful as to make it evil: this dammage only proceeds from thy ſin. Avoid ſin &amp; culpable negligence, &amp; death wil be a thing deſirable.</p>

                  <p> Men fear little and regard les the death of the ſoul which only is evil and may be avoided; but the death of the body which is not evil and cannot be avoided they ſeek to ſhun, though it be rather to be deſird then that we adhere to this wicked world. O the madnes of men, who abuſe &amp; play as it were bopeep with that precept of Chriſt about lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our enemyes, while they care for none but the world who hates us &amp; is our profeſſd enemy! why do we affect this fleeting life which flyes us, and do not affect that perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent life which expects us? Why are we ſo ſollicitous for our temporal life which we cannot retain, and neglect eternal which we may obtain? we may have life everlaſting if we wil; we ſhal looſe this tranſitory whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we wil or no: and notwithſtanding all this, men wil not do profitably for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, what they do unprofitably for this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral: they covet not the firſt, and they dread the death of this ſecond as one would do a miſchief.</p>
                  <p>Death moreover is a rare invention of Gods mercy: for it eaſeth us of all the moleſtations of this life, and takes away an eternity of miſeries. What a pittiful thing would it be, if we were for all eternity ſubject to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsities of riſing daily and going to bed, of eating, of cold and heat, of toyl and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, of ſeeking our ſuſtenance of carking, &amp; caring, of ſuffering affronts, or ſpending our whole life in a ſordid and laborious drudgery?

                     </gap>otoriouſly wicked ſought death and made away with themſelves merely to avoid theſe inconveniencies: at leaſt let us not dread it that it may be a paſſage to future felicity, and for both theſe reſpects let us patiently accept it. When God beheld us involved by the ſin of Adam in ſuch a labyrinth of woes, he in his moſt indulgent clemency invented for our good the deviſe of dying, that our calamities might not be perpetual, combining in the ſame thing a penalty and a benefit, juſtice &amp; mercy. Therfore becauſe death is ſo great a good, ſo proper and ſecure an effect of his goodnes, he would not have it lyable to mans free wil, or the hatred of an enemy. For although it be in any ones power to bereave thee of life, no body, not even the uncon troulable violence of kings can bereave thee of death. This is the property of things of the beſt quality, to be out of the reach of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power, &amp; not to be obnoxious to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pleaſure. If one were entangled in any one danger or incumbrance, it would be no ſmal content to find a meanes how to evade it: why do we then grieve or dread death, which, is the gate wherby we may rid our ſelves of the hazards and incumbrances of this life. Many for a meer puntillio of worldly glory have ſought and covetted it; at leaſt for the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:39021:225"/> glory of heaven let us not fear it.</p>
                  <p>O immortal God, who waſt born not to live (for thou waſt life eternal as now thou art) but to dye a moſt mortal and bitter death for me: why ſhould I that am mortal be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to dye, to live a vital, eternal, and moſt pleaſant life with thee and for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of thy wil? ſince the deſire of a chriſtian is to be with Chriſt, I know not why he ſhould not deſire death, ſince but by it he cannot come to that fruition. What miſery can death bring or what happines can it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave him of, who is not beſotted upon the world, but hath placed all his felicity in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? but beſides this ocean of content which flowes from the ſight and fruition of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, it hath moreover this advantage that it puts us out of further danger of offending God. Death then is not evil, which takes away all evil.</p>
                  <p>But if it be evil and an enemy to mankind, why do not men treat it like an evil, and as one would treat an enemy? I wiſh we would proceed in this manner with it, and deal no otherwiſe then with a foe, forecaſting that we carry nothing about us, which he may make booty of, or give him cauſe of trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing over us. Souldiers are wont to ſecure their proviſions and baggage or els quite ſpoil them, that they may not be ſerviceable to their enemyes. We muſt leave no plunder for death; but if there be any thing ſubject to its rapine, it muſt eyther be wholly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:39021:225"/> or ſent before us with a ſafe convoy to heaven, where all will be throughly ſecured. We muſt keep no ſpoiles about us in which it may glory but the luggage of our fleſh; and we muſt extenuate it by faſting, labour and other pennances that he ſieze it not entire. If death be evil and adverſe to us let us reſiſt it, and object a buckler by relinquiſhing things and all affection to them, that its wounds may bite the les upon us: if death be evil let us make it good by doing good. Why ſhould we dread death more then our ſelves, ſince it cannot be worſe then we are evil? yea it is we that make it bad, becauſe we do not become good. Let us do this now when we have time and may do what we ſhal wiſh at its hour we had don and cannot. A little reſpit only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines for labour, and in compariſon of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity not ſo much as an inſtant. Behold now ſo many years of our life are paſt and thoſe which remain are no longer.</p>
                  <p>But death is not evil in it ſelf but rather good: and we ſhould be very good if we did imitate it, and practiſed what it puts in ure, by diſpoyling our ſelves of all things: ſo that if nothing were grateful and delectable in this world, it would be pleaſing and ſavory to our pallat. He only needs fear death who loves other things and not Chriſt. He is not a faithful ſervant who refuſeth to appear in the preſence of his maſter. If I did love thee, o Lord, I ſhould not have ſuch a horrour of death: for it would be contentiue to me to
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:39021:226"/> behold thee face to face, and caſt my ſelf into thy embracements, rejoicing that thy wil were accompliſhd in me: otherwiſe I play but the hypocrite when I daily beg that thy wil may be done in earth as it is in heaven. Thy pleaſure was to dye not that we might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal in this mortality, but that we might dye wel by leading a better life. Grant me grace, that as thy wil is to be fulfilld in my death though againſt my wil, ſo I may wil and death fulfil it in a good death by a better and more perfect life.</p>
                  <p>I give thee thanks, o moſt benign Lord, for this benefit of death as thy wiſdome hath diſpoſed it: I give thee thanks that I am to dye: and that I know not when, or where, or how I am to dye. The certainty of death is good and comfortable to me, it being a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure paſſage to bring me to thy ſight, and rid me of the miſeries of this life, and make me deſpiſe its deceitful and counterfeyt goods. What man, if he have but any one grain of wit, although he were ſure never to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience any adverſity, but were to be ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all the contingencies of this life, would not contemn it and all its goods, ſince he muſt needs ſee that he is to quit them all in death which is wholly unavoydable. In which moment all paſt joyes, all preſent goods now to be relinquiſhd are no more then if they never had enjoyd a being; nay they are les conducible, for their very relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wil prove a torture. That only which
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:39021:226"/> man neyther loves nor poſſeſſeth wil not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him in that hour of affliction. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty alſo of the manner, place and time of dying is acceptable to me, that I may more certainly ſerve thee, o God, in all requiſite manner, time, and place as thy worth and dignity doth require. This is a divine diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal which breeds in us a certain ſollicitude of a better life, by reaſon of the uncertain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a contingent death.</p>
                  <p>I am throughly perſwaded, o Lord, that I know not whether I am worthy of love or hatred, and how it wil fare with me after this life: neither do I covet to know, becauſe it is expedient for me to be ignorant of it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ordainment of thy wiſdome. But I will not therfore more dread death then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thee, and confide in thy mercies. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept moſt willingly its great uncertainty, this being moſt certain, that it is enough for me that thou art moſt merciful, and a cordial lover of me, and both canſt and wilt ſave me if I but humbly truſt in thee. What imports it that I know not how and when and where I am to dye, if I be aſſurd that thou dyedſt for me, and dyedſt the death of the croſs, and at noon day, and betwixt two thieves upon Mount Calvary to clear all doubt of thy love towards me, that I may fully confide in thee? Of my ſelf, o Lord I am able to do nothing, neyther to live wel nor dye wel; but by thee I can do both, I hope for both and wil effect both; and if I have not lived wel thou haſt
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:39021:227"/> given me a deſire, o Lord, to become truly penitent, and I hope by thy meanes to amend henceforth my future life; why then ſhal I not alſo hope to dye wel? my hope wil not be entire, nor my confidence ſufficient if I hope the one and diſpair of the other. I both have been and am an enormous ſinner: but is it not perchance in thy power to diſpoſe of thy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature as thou thinks beſt? Thy deſire is, o Lord, to ſave me, thou wilt I know, be merciful to me.</p>

That very thing which I have not I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count my benefit, becauſe thou, o Lord, art the giver who divideſt according to each ones expedient and exigence, and denieſt nothing but for our good. Whatſoever alſo thou conferſt upon others all that I reckon as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit done to me. Thou obligeſt me with ſo many good turnes that I cannot but love thee, o fountain of Goodnes, although thou wert not good, yea although thou wert evil. Thou, o Lord, art in very deed ſo good, that although in lieu of ſo many benefits as thou haſt conferd upon me, thou hadſt heapd ſo many injuries, I could not chuſe but love thee. It is not need full to make me love thee to have bin ſo bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, it is not needful to have loved me: thou art ſo good, that although thou didſt hate me, I were to love thee, &amp; ought to love thee more then all my lovers and benefactours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit thou hadſt been injurious &amp; malevolous.</p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:39021:228"/>
                  <p> Why was it needful to overwhelm him with innumerable bleſsings, whom by one thou extractedſt out of nothing? thou deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt nothing more of me then my ſelf alone. I owe my ſelf now to thee for the firſt benefit becauſe by it thou gaveſt me wholly to my ſelf: why then doſt thou ſuperadd ſo many more? why after the giving of me to my ſelf, doſt thou over and above give thy ſelf to me? I my ſelf &amp; all that's mine am no trifling debt of thine; neyther have I any thing beſides my ſelf: what I have I moſt willingly give to wit my ſelf. But why wilt thou enhaunce the debt which I am not able to defray, by giving thy ſelf? Go too, o infirm ſpirit, find meanes to diſcharge this alſo. Thou mayſt reſtore God to God if thou haſt God.

It is much better to love God who loves to his utmoſt, and without any ſtint, who cannot but love thee if thou loveſt him. O immenſe goodnes, why doſt, thou love me whom all creatures have reaſon to deteſt? Why doſt thou covet to be loved by me, picking me out from among ſo many lovers of thine? me who am moreover unworthy to be rankd among the divels, to whoſe ſervice I mancipated my ſelf, in ſo much that a peculiar and more raging hel is due to me for contemning thee after ſo ſignal and ſhameles a manner, who vouchſafedſt to dye for me and not for the Angels.</p>
                  <p>It is but meet that I at length begin to love
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:39021:229"/> him who from the beginning loved me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning, &amp; loves me to the end without end, expecting from all eternity that I ſhould love him. I have loved ſome that love not me; now I wil love him who loved me before I knew him; who being loved never fayles to correſpond in love, and by loving forceth others to love him: whom to love is the flower of vertue and by whom to be loved is the top of felicity. Why doubteſt thou, o my ſoul, to love him who is forced to love thee faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, if thou love ſome, who perchance wil love thee perfidiouſly. Thou wilt have but a hard bargain in loving goods, which, if thou haſt a rival do vex thee; or men, who, if they love any other, do make thee jealous. The love of God is free from all ſorrow and care; that it loves others wil occaſion thy joy; that others love it, wil be thy harts-deſire. This is the all ſufficing goodnes of God, that it both loves and is beloved by all without any ones prejudice eyther the lover or beloved, but with the great content of all. Other things are narrow-bounded and needy, they ſuffice not to love two or be loved by two without detriment to one party.</p>
                  <p>Settle not thy affection upon things periſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for thou wilt daily periſh in them without end. Settle it upon things eternal that thou mayſt live happily for all eternity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly in this interim till it commence. Quit thy ſelf of all love of corruptible things, and thou ſhalt quit thy ſelf of al the miſeries which
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:39021:229"/> befall man. Thou who ſeekeſt to be happy by loving, why doſt thou love thoſe things, which by merely loving them render thee mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable? love him rather who will make thee fortunate even among the misfortunes of this life. Why doſt thou love thoſe goods whoſe fruition makes thee evil, whoſe deſire makes thee unhappy? why doſt thou love men, whoſe non-correſpondence makes thee angry, whoſe correſpondence, ridiculous and effeminate. Fix rather thy love upon God, whoſe deſire wil make thee good whoſe fruition wil make thee happy. Love not thoſe beauties which deforme thee; but love him, whoſe love wil render thee beautiful. It is a great fondnes to love thoſe goods, the ſole love wherof deprives thee worthily of their poſſeſsion; and not to love that good which is only to be enjoyd by love. The goods which thou loveſt are not thine but thou theirs; wherfore thou art in want of them: God being beloved by thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thine; whom if thou loveſt thou canſt not want, &amp; only wanteſt him when thou doſt not love him: by not beſtowing thy love upon other things, God in himſelf beſtowes them upon thee.</p>
                  <p>Why doſt thou love a good which is needy of another good, &amp; not that which abounds with all goods? when a good is loved which needs another good, the miſery is augmented not the want diminiſhed. All the goods of this world are neceſsitous, none of them is all-ſufficient by it ſelf, but requires the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:39021:230"/> of another: love that good which is ſo good of himſelf as to be indigent of no other good: All good things are good by goodnes, and conſequently all ſtand in need of it to make them good. Goodnes ſufficeth of it ſelf and requires no additional conſort: if thou loveſt it, thou wilt both be good and happy: love him alone who alone is all things. Do not love thoſe goods which covet not to be loved by thee; but love him whom all things covet to love, thy Creator who both loves thee and covets to be loved by thee, and created all good things for thy ſake. It is a kind of abſurd ſtolidity not to love God who covets to be loved by thee, and to love a piece of clay which hath no ſuch reſentment. Why art thou ſo inquiſitive after what may pleaſe thy eye and delight thy pallat, and art ſo inſenſible of what doth perfect thy wil?</p>
                  <p>Love is to be ſquard out only according to the rule of God; and therfore it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by no other line, nor doth it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in any thing elſe. The ſhoe of Golias wil never exactly fit the foot of Zacchaeus. Love is the firſt guift; to whom is it due but to the firſt good and prime benefactor? love is a guift by it ſelf; on whom is it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowd but on him who is good by himſelf? love is a guift by its own nature, to whom is it to be offerd but to him who is good by his own nature? love is a guift which is the ſource of all other guifts; to whom is it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be conſecrated then to that eſſence of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:39021:230"/> good which is the ſource of all eſſences. Love of it ſelf without the acceſs of other guifts is acceptable, and others without it are little pleaſing; to whom doth it ſquare better then to God, who of himſelf is amiable &amp; pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and without him nothing muſt be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? o Lord, how can I love thee worthily ſince I cannot ſerve thee worthily, I being not able to afford thee any competent ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All things are thine; and whatſoever I have it is from thee, becoming as it were a ſervant to me.

                  <p>Moſt evident it is that in all reaſon we ought to carry a greater ſpite and deadlier feud to our ſelves then all our enemies: &amp; for as much as concerns ſelf-affection the les it makes thee regard the glory of God, and comply with his holy wil, and ſeek the advance of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour, thou oughtſt in all reaſon to be more immeaſurably cruel againſt thy ſelf then againſt any enemy or the whol camp of hel; although in effect, and in the exteriour ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration of thy body a diſcreet mean is to be held, according to the direction of thy ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and ghoſtly Father and the preſcript of right reaſon; to the end that in this alſo thou maiſt ſeek Gods greater glory, for whoſe ſake it is expedient not to be immoderate in chaſtizing thy ſelf; as for the ſame reaſon and our own ſalvation we are forced to pardon our

What an incredible brand of perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſnes, cruelty, &amp; in humanity would fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that man, he would incur the deteſtation of all, as being much more blame worthy then all. O moſt beneficent truth! thou haſt committed my ſafety only to my own truſt as who would be truſtyeſt to my ſelf; but I prove moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous above all others, divels, men, hell, &amp; the world, all of them are my ſworn enemyes, but they all remain diſarmd, if I my ſelf do not arme them, they all wil be innocent, if I to my ſelf be not nocent. All the prejudice I can receive is within the reach of my own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, neyther can any body really hurt me but by my permiſsion, unles my wil be ſuch, unles I betray my ſelf. I alone am the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect of all the injuries which befal me from others, though I impute them falſely to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſtop the influences of Gods beneficence, I hinder the effects of his guifts; I infect his graces and corrupt his vertues, abuſing both the one and the other; how then ſhal I flatter my ſelf who am ſo burdenſome to my ſelf, how ſhal I cheriſh and ſooth my ſelf who am ſuch a mortal enemy to my ſelf? All the hatred I can vent is not equivalent to my own inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſnes.
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:39021:233"/> How often have I cheated my ſelf, how many faults have I contracted? I have defrauded my ſelf of heaven, I have neglected the bleſsings of Gods grace; and not to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber up all my ſpiritual loſſes which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number, what penſivenes of hart, what affliction of mind, what diſaſters in my goods, what loſſes in my temporals, how many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſeaſes, contempts, revilements, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſions have I brought upon my ſelf, by the diſordinatenes of my paſsions, by my little circumſpection and following the guſt of my appetite? If juſt occaſion being given any one contriſtate me I am highly offended; and why am I not ſo with my ſelf ſince upon alloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions I am injurious to my ſelf? If thou, o lying man, hadſt but once catchd one in a lye thou wouldſt never truſt him afterwards; and having ſo often belyed and cozend thy ſelf, thou yet truſts thy ſelf, and art not at all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of thy proceedings.</p>
                  <p>But why do I recount my own injuries? it is a ſufficient motive to make me abhor and proſecute with a pious hatred whatſoever is mine, for that all have proved as ſo many obſtacles to retard my endeavours in loving God. O moſt holy &amp; faithful truth, I ought to loath and hate my ſelf for being ſo wicked and diſloyal to my ſelf; how much more for being wicked and perfidious to thee? for my own ſake it behoovd me to deteſt my ſelf; how much more, o Lord, for thine? becauſe I loved not my ſelf orderly I ſhould in reaſon
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:39021:233"/> have hated my ſelf; how much more becauſe I loved thee not at all, who alone ſhould be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all. I loved not thee becauſe I knew not how to love my ſelf; yea I loved not my ſelf, becauſe I loved not what in reality I was, but ſome what elſe les conſiderable. I loved not my ſoul which is my chief and nobleſt portion; but only my body, as if I were noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but it, which is abſurdly falſe: for I have alſo a ſoul for whoſe ranſome the Son of God by way of exchange gave his. To love a part of my ſelf I loved not my whole ſelf; and what is more to be lamented I loved not that which to me is all in all, God my Saviour.</p>
                  <p>If thou be carried with a zeal towards God, o perfidious man, thou canſt not but be fraught with hatred towards thy ſelf; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that ſo far as thou haſt prejudiced or wrongd thy ſelf, thou be indulgent to thy ſelf; there remaines yet ſufficient cauſe of ſelfrevenge for not loving God and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his commands. Thou art not a litle moved when thou heareſt the perverſenes of Caiphas and the treachery of Iudas, and the very nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them puts thee into chollar: why then wilt thou be partial and ſoft-natured to thy ſelf? tel me, o proud ſpirit, if thou haſt but one dram of true humility, that is, of truth, doſt thou not hold thy ſelf the worſt of all ſinners? nay this is nothing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſince S. Paul framed no better conceit of himſelf. Wherfore thou muſt deem thy ſelf the perverſeſt of creatures, &amp; when thou
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:39021:234"/> haſt done ſo, thou proudly rankeſt thy ſelf above thy degree. Nevertheles I demand of thee, if thou holdſt thy ſelf ſuch, then by conſequence worſe then Iudas or Caiphas or any other: but if thou judgeſt ſo in very deed, proceed conſequently leſt thou be taxed and derided by the Angels; and either out of love, or hatred, or zeal take ſevere puniſhment of thy ſelf as being the ring-leader of all that crew: Conſider now out of this, whether the ſin of Iudas, and thoſe of Anti-chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve love yea or no? if God had committed to thy charge the doing juſtice upon him who gave IESVS that injurious blow, or him that ſpit firſt in that face on which the Angels love to gaze, or on the accurſed Arrius and Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, or the maligneſt of men Antichriſt, or the Father of lyes Lucifer, to puniſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignly their ſins, as juſtice and equity ſhould dictate to thee; how wouldſt thou carry thy ſelf towards them? wouldſt thou perchance ſooth and flatter and ſeek to humour them to thy ability; or rather ſtrive to ſhew in the ſight of all creatures, how much the glory of God and his honour ſo often violated were preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to a juſt revenge? thou oughtſt to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe no les ſeverity againſt thy ſelf: for thou muſt needs hold thy ſelf worſe then any of them, if thou makeſt not a counterfeyt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of thy own baſenes; and I ſuppoſe thou intendeſt not to cozen eyther God or thy ſelf. It behooves thee to be moved with a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and fruitful indignation againſt thy ſelf
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:39021:234"/> then againſt the perverſeſt of divels. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel committed one ſole ſin &amp; that in thought only, for which he incurd eternal damnation: thou haſt committed innumerable and thoſe of fact alſo. He ſind againſt God to whom his obligations were not ſo binding: for an Angel did not become God, nor did God ſuffer torments for them; he did not at any time pardon them, as he became man for thee, ſhedding his moſt pretious blood for thy ſake, ſealing thy pardon, and ready to ſeal it for the future, not ſeven times only but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty ſeven &amp; more. Conſider now whether it would be accounted laudable to contract familiarity with that great Prince of divels, &amp; ſeek his honour &amp; content in all? why holdſt thou too ſtrict a friendſhip with thy ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring thy honour procuring thy eaſe, and ſeeking thy wil and pleaſure in all? I demand of thee once more, if God ſhould deliver into thy hands that malign ſpirit who hath ſo often deceived thee, tempted thee, and induced thee to ſin, miſleading thee from the way of ſalvation, &amp; then another who were les hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, commanding thee to puniſh both accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the qualities of the loſſes wherewith they damnifyd thee: againſt which wouldſt thou be more cruel? againſt him that were les noxious or the other who proved thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier enemy? But how canſt thou be ſo indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to thy ſelf, thou being more inſolent towards thy ſelf and more pernicious, I do not ſay then the worſt of theſe divels, but
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:39021:235"/> then both, ſince neyther of them could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammage thee in the leaſt, unles thou coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratedſt &amp; gaveſt conſent? thou haſt often playd the ſeducer and enemy to thy ſelf; thou haſt often tempted and proved a ſtumbling block of ſcandal to thy ſelf; I know not then with what eyes thou canſt look upon thy ſelf, thou being more prejudicial and a greater un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing to thy ſelf then Caiphas, Arrius, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt or Lucifer: O ſoul, I conjure thee by the love of IESVS, to conſider theſe things, whether they be not true: if it be true that thou art a greater croſs and loſs to thy ſelf then the accurſed Lucifer could have been, love not thy ſelf diſordinately, if thou be touchd with any ſenſe of promoting the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God or amplifying his glory: for by how much thou ſwelſt with the tyde of ſelf eſteem and ſelf affection by ſo much in order to the effects of grace and vertues doth God flow in thee at a lower ebb: and by how much thou draineſt thy ſelf of thy ſelf by an humble ſelf hatred, ſo much the more wil God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh thee with his waters of grace even to a great profundity. Who then is a greater enemy to thy ſelf then thou thy ſelf, who wilt not let God be exalted in thee?</p>
                  <p>But if thou wilt not hate thy ſelf, o un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy man, more then the reſt of thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes; at leaſt look upon thy ſelf as upon an enemy, and bear thy ſelf as little good wil, nor take too much complacence in that fit of ſelf-proſperity and corporal delight. When
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:39021:235"/> any adverſity befals him whom thou oweſt a ſpite, thou art not a little contented therewith; and ſo muſt thou proceed with thy ſelf: when thy enemy is ſleighted or derided it cauſeth joy and complacence in thee; and ſo muſt it do when thou thy ſelf art ſo treated. One wil not make much of an enemy, nor feaſt him at a table of delights; neyther muſt thou do ſo with thy ſelf. One would alwayes be vexing and moleſting an enemy, ſitting cloſe upon his skirts and taking all occaſions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: ſo muſt thou alſo do if thou wilt act that part, for this is properly to be ſpiteful. If thou doſt not hold this tenour, thou art pittifully ſeduced, as thinking thy ſelf not ſick of ſelf love. Where Gods divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure interpoſeth not it ſelf thou muſt with a maſculin courage for his greater glory kil all ſelf affection in thee. Yet out of the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the practiſe of exteriour auſterities, one muſt permit himſelf to be guided by ſome diſcreet perſon zealous of the divine honour, that ſo he may alſo offer in ſacrifice an obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of his wil and judgment.</p>
                  <p>Yet thou muſt not frame ſuch a conceit as if the life of ſelf denying people, and thoſe that loath &amp; perſecute themſelves were harſh and inſupportable: yea of all others it parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes moſt of joy. The love of God is much more light-harted then is ſelf love. If ſelf hatred brought no other advantage beſides lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, that were ſufficient. It is much more available that God love thee ardently then
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:39021:236"/> that thou love thy ſelf. God can be much more advantageous to thee, and he takes content in communicating joyes, to give us a fore-taſt of his inebriating and beatifying ſweetnes, comforting us amidſt the troubles of this life and recreating us by exhibiting an experiment of his deliciouſnes. The Apoſtles went rejoycing from before the face of the councel, becauſe they were made worthy to ſuffer a contumely for the name of IESVS. Call to mind that admirable but true ſaying: deem it all joy when ye fall into ſeveral rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. God could draw relief for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Babilonian furnace from their very flames and turn their ſcorching heat into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing dew; he is alſo able to make adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties no wayes burdenſome. Further more if we rejoyce in their evils whom we hate, thou wilt do no les in the miſeries which befall thee: and ſince thy croſſes are much more numerous then thy crownes, there muſt neceſſarily be more frequent occaſions of joy, then ſelf love could ever miniſter. Incommodities are all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ready and at hand; commodities rare and long to be ſought for: wherfore he muſt needs have frequent occaſions of rejoycing who rejoyceth in his adverſities, ſince he ſhal never want matter of ſuffering in this life. Evil things are not ſo obnoxious to caſualty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s as good. The fruition of good things is ſayd to be caſual, becauſe they happen caſually &amp; but ſeldome: ſo doth not the multiplicity of evils; wherfore his joy wil ſuffer les interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:39021:236"/> who joyes leaſt in wordly ſolaces. O what a content is it to disburden ones ſelf of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to live exempted from all impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and carking care of ſelf ſeeking intereſt! I conceive that he who hath quitted and relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed himſelf, hath evaded in greateſt part the miſeries and vexations of this life.</p>
                  <p>Neyther is it a mean fruit of a ſerious and ſincere hatred of our ſelves, that it cauſeth us to love others. Conſider how inſolent and powerful an enemy ſelf love is: it hath ſo much of the tyrant that it intrencheth upon charity and outing it, ſupplies its functions both towards man and God himſelf, it alone conſuming and devouring all the affection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for both. He that loves himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately knowes neyther how to love God nor his neighbour: he that truly hates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will love even thoſe that annoy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute him; he wil rejoyce if any one do wrongfully oppreſs him, knowing that to be depreſſed in him which is his main obſtacle &amp; opponent, and ought in all reaſon to be hated and perſecuted by him: and ſince no body takes it ill, if one jointly together with him moleſt and infeſt his deadly enemy, but rather holds him worthy of thanks; ſo he that is a hater of himſelf wil rather love then be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe affected towards one that lends a helping hand to perſecute him.</p>
                  <p>Another and no ſorry fruit of ſelf hatred is, that it makes us deteſt ſin: all that vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous brood deſcends lineally from ſelf love
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:39021:237"/> which is the parent and nurſe of all vice and concupiſcence, and from it all the reſt of that gang derive their pedegree. He that rejoyceth at an injury, wil not offend by being angry; nor he that covets to be contemned, by pride; nor he by impatience who eſteems himſelf worthy of all puniſhment. It is no mean fruit that it removes all impediments in the love of God; it is no ſmal benefit that it ſubdues thee to thy ſelf, and puts thee in a full and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble poſſeſſion of thy ſelf. Laſtly if thou wilt know what huge advantages ariſe from ſelf hatred thou muſt conſider how much grace ſurpaſſeth ſin and vertue vice: it is ſo much more excellent to hate ones ſelf out of vertue then to love out of vice. If men even to their utter undoing hate thoſe that have much les endammagd them then thou thy ſelf; thou who of all others haſt been thy ſaddeſt foe, muſt out of the motive of vertue, prayſe, &amp; recompenſe, do no les.</p>

<pb n="443" facs="tcp:39021:237"/> wel. Learn, o infirm ſpirit; to love crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without being injurious. Many times the manner of loving ſtands parallel with that of hatred or contumely. Thou wilt do a friend whom thou loveſt a great injury, if thou wiſh him riches as a real and ſolid good; for by ſo doing thou ſheweſt thy ſelf to love them better then him: for them thou loveſt as being all ſufficient, him as needy: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wilt rather chuſe to want him then them. Hence fortune is the umpyre of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips; and its viciſsitude is the death of love and birth of treachery. Hence an equal dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ariſeth to ſincere fidelity, whether thou loveſt thy friend for riches, or riches in thy friend. As it is alſo a like tenour of true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when thou loveſt all for God, &amp; when thou loveſt him alone in them, becauſe he alone is the object of thy love. Thou wouldſt love nothing els but God in all, if thou lovedſt nothing but him. This muſt be the touch ſtone of thy love to try whether it be true charity or no. He that loves not riches at all, cannot love them as good to another. Let God be the common benefit which thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt to beſtow upon all; whom alone if thou give, thou wilt make them rich enough. And be ſure to regard more ſuch benefits in which thou loveſt all, then ſuch by which thou ſhalt be loved by all: for he that loves all truly as it behooveth, ſhal be ſaved; but he ſhall not therfore be ſaved becauſe he is loved by all.</p>

                  <p> We muſt not be ſo baſe-conceyted of love as to hold it ſaleable at any rate: it muſt all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be given gratis. He ſels God who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes a charity upon another, out of any other motive then charity. Caſt thy courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes into no bodies diſh: but as thou eſteemſt whatſoever is conferd upon thee by others as ſo many bleſsings coming from God, and thankfully attributeſt them to him alone; ſo muſt thou eſteem it Gods bleſsing not thine whatſoever thou imparteſt to others: yea reckon this as the greateſt of all, that he would be pleaſed to uſe thee for his inſtrument and Almner in dividing his benefits. Ground thy love towards others not upon temporal moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves but ſpiritual; for that foundation which is layd upon them and not upon the H. Ghoſt is covetouſnes not charity, not love towards man but liſt and luſt of creatures. In like manner be as forward in doing good offices to others, as thou wouldſt have God to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee: proceed upon no other tearmes with others then he doth with thee. Grant, o love of loves, that I may love all as thou lovedſt me and all: grant that I may love all for thee, and none love me for my ſelf. I could rather wiſh if it might be done without ſin, that each one ſhould hate me rather then love me, if they would love me for my ſelf: for if each one did hate me I ſhould have but my due; if they loved me for my ſelf I ſhould uſurp what is thine.

<pb n="447" facs="tcp:39021:239"/> to that end: what is thy meaning then, when thou takeſt on and grieveſt for ſome croſs event, when thou repineſt at ſome malady, wrong, vexation, misfortune, whether ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to thy ſelf or another, whether publick or private? doth God err and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or doth he afflict us out of enuy and malice? did his omnipotency fall short that he could not go through with what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to avert this which thou deemſt a loſs? it happend not through any weaknes in God, or malice, or deceit, but out of his power, providence, and immenſe goodnes: why doſt thou reject and ſeek to annul what the divine attributes ratify and make the ſubject of their employment?</p>
                  <p>Put thy ſelf into the hands of God, that he who created thee to his glory may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and govern thee; he orders all to this end, and without all doubt wil bring thee thither unles thou fruſtrate his deſignes. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet not to be governd according to thy own fancy. He that makes a journy by ſea takes not upon him to ſteer the ſhip, but leaves that entirely to the Pilot; &amp; when a ſtorm ariſeth then is he moſt tractable, and wil neyther do nor permit any thing to be done contrary to the others appointment. Doſt thou hold God les skilful in ruling the world then a pilot in ſteering his ship? what thou permitteſt then to a man who is to land thee ſafely in thy har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, why wilt thou not permit to God who is to carry thee to the port of heaven? God
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:39021:240"/> knowes moſt exactly wel how to mannage his family, the world I mean; he needs not thy adviſe; leave all that care to him, he wil carry thee to the land of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>God is either propitious or angry when he ſends thee theſe croſſes ſo diſrelliſhing: if propitious, why wilt thou not acquieſce to thy own good, and add thy own ſuffrage to thoſe things which make ſo much for thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage? if he be angry, thou muſt give way, if it be but to mitigate it. An angry man if any contradict him waxeth more angry; if no body croſs him he is preſently calme: in like manner God will be pacified if thou not only hold thy peace and brook it, but alſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and thankful. O ſenſles man how dareſt thou ſay, I wil not have this, or I wil have that, being thou knoweſt not what wil make for thy good? why doſt thou refuſe to ſuffer croſſes, injuries, &amp; humiliations? perchance thou haſt forgotten that thou art a ſinner, or rememberſt not that God can turn theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and humiliations into inſtruments of glory? the hatred of the brethren, and that inhumane ſale of his deareſt child occaſioned ſafety to Iacob, and glory and a kingdom to Ioſeph that was ſold. for although

Thou art not made to thy own glory, nor to enjoy thy own wil nor pleaſure, nor to ſave thy ſelf alone, nor to enrich thy ſelf, nor advance thy fortunes, nay nor only to enjoy God in his kingdom: thy end is more ſublime then all this: thou art, to witt, created to the glory of God, which was the but and ſcope of his wil and power in creating all things. O end of a high elevation! and it maiſt thou compaſs by ſuffering, whether it be in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary labours or extraordinary torments. Thou art not thy own but Gods; nor born to thy ſelf but to him: ſo neyther muſt thou aym at any thing but the glory of God and how to pleas him, and that his wil be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in thee. That wil only prove fuel for the fire of purgatory whatſoever nouriſheth in thee thy own wil. Covet nothing whether it be ſpiritual conſolations or other guifts
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:39021:241"/> though very holy, but what God covetteth above all; ſince he wiſheth thee more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines and ſanctity then thou canſt thy ſelf; &amp; by this meanes thou ſhalt enjoy, though it be not to be ſought for continual comfort. All the afflictions and miſeries which annoy man in this lifes intercourſe conſiſt in the wil, becauſe it ſtands not in a true conformity with the divine. The harts of men are diſquietted eyther becauſe they have not what they would have, or becauſe they would not have what they have: wherefore he that quits himſelf of all ſelf wil, quits himſelf alſo of all trouble. He that ſtands parallel with God in willing or not willing ſhal poſſeſs perpetual joy, becauſe he ſhal perpetually enjoy his wiſh: for that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes done which God wil have done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his order or permiſsion.</p>

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:39021:241"/> of lawful deſires; nor mortify only our fleſh but looſe alſo our ſoul, that ſo we may gain it totally at long running. Both our fleſh &amp; our ſpirit have been found delinquents to almighty God. It were a piece of injuſtice to puniſh one co-partner and quit the other; to fine the ſervant and let the maſter go ſcot free. We muſt do juſtice both upon fleſh and ſoul; not as many, who contenting themſelves with outward auſterities, are not ſollicitous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the interiour. But ſince the ſoul is the prime criminal, ſhe in the firſt place muſt ſmart for it; and there is no other way of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtring her but in her wil, by denying or cutting ſhort whatſoever ſhe likes or takes guſt in. The ſoul which hath been contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous towards God is worthy of death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt die to its own wil in all things, &amp; ſuffer in that wherein it hath been delinquent. In nothing at all neyther little nor great muſt it procure or regard its intereſt: otherwiſe if it be thus open-eyd it is not to be numberd among the dead. Be mindful in nothing of thy own wil. Do the wil of God, do the wil of thy brother, do the wil of thy enemy &amp; him that injures thee rather then thy own, if it may be accompliſhed without ſin. Thou wilt not arrive to a ſufficient degree of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, unles thou reſign and tranſmit thy wil not only to God but alſo to man, yea even to thy very enemies.</p>
                  <p>Be not too credulous in thoſe things to which thy wil is carried with an impetuoſity
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:39021:242"/> without having regard to the rule of reaſon; but hold them all ſuſpected, although they hold forth never ſo faire a ſhew of good: they are for the moſt part but a mere officiouſnes or branchings of the ſenſual part which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel makes uſe of to cloak his craft. Let thy wil ſeek the glory of God, and not grieve at the contempt of men; let it attend and be ſenſible of the divine pleaſure not thy own affliction: let it be wholly emploid upon God, and it wil find enough to do: let it learn to wave all ſelf content and proper guſt though ſpiritual. Although God relinquiſh thee to thy ſelf in thy hardeſt preſſures, in thy ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual deſolations amidſt the very powers of darknes, aſſaild on all ſides with tribulations and temptations, thou muſt ſtill perſiſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſeeking no redreſs of comfort, being ready to ſuſtain that ſhock and any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpable calamity of thy ſoul, ſo long as God ſhal be pleaſed to continue it, though even to the day of judgment or for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. He that covets to ſerve God in truth muſt ſerve him gratis, rather wiſhing and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to be debard of all comfort; deeming this abundantly ſufficient if he can but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that place of his ſoul, where God hath fixt his reſidence, pure and unblemmiſhed; not permitting any thing elſe to enter and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there as in the holy of holyes. Thither muſt the high Prieſt IESVS only find entrance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some ſervants of God who were deluged with a ſea of comforts obtaind by prayer the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:39021:242"/> up of theſe heavenly ſluces, and to be deprived of all ſweetnes: neyther would they afterwards admit of any ſuch infuſions though from heaven: for ſome have not been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who refuſed Angels for their comforters. For what great matter doſt thou in rejecting acorporal guſt which wil rather prove an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction? that bodily ſolace which hinders divine joy and ſweetnes of ſpirit is too afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: God deſerves more at our hands then this. For him thou muſt contemn all jubily of ſpirit, and whatſoever is pleaſing to nature and ſelf wil. The ſervice of a hireling is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtant nor faithful. If thou ſerve God out of hope of comfort or relief though it be ſpiritual, thou loveſt not God himſelf, and this comfort failing thee, thou wilt often become ſlouthfully tepid. Hence it is that we are ſubject to ſo many mutations, that we are remiſs, that we make ſmal progreſs; for as mariners hope for the wind ſo do we for the ſpirit of devotion and conſolation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we are becalmd, and any adverſity, like a contrary blaſt, beats us back: yea we are much worſe then mariners who know how to make way with a ſide or adverſe wind. Let us learn to advance forward even amidſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, aridities, and tribulations. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports not whether thou ſerve God for the ſenſibility of interiour comfort; or for ſome corporal commodity, but only that thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice comes of les freely; becauſe requiring this guſt of ſpirit thou ſelleſt it at a dearer rate.
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:39021:243"/> God is more valuable then thy guſt: it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have God then joy: and yet where canſt thou be, o moſt delicious and ſweet-relliſhing God, and the ſpirit ſhal not exult, if thou diſcovereſt thy ſelf to it? where ſhal thy benignity diſplay it ſelf &amp; the ſoul ſhal not be repleniſhed with exceſs of joy? but grant me that I may never wiſh my own joy, but that thou maiſt be it; never ſeek the guſt of my own wil, but the good pleaſure &amp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of thine.</p>
                  <p>O afflicted ſpirit, if thou wouldſt never ſeek thy own content &amp; comfort, how much content wouldſt thou find! he that leaves houſe or land for God ſhal receive a hundred fold reward: there is no equity that he who relinquiſheth more ſhould receive les. He that relinquiſheth his own wil and its content, ſhal receive a hundred fold more in the ſame ſpecies for denying it, then if he had given way to it; for he doth the wil of God and ſhal deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly receive a more ample recompenſe. The more thou divorceſt thy ſelf from all guſt of ſelf wil and intereſt the more deliciouſly wilt thou relliſh the divine wil; a heavenly kind of taſt and joy wil be infuſed into thy hart. If God had made any one man ſo happy as to be in a perpetual fruition of his own wil, no ſooner ſaid but done; and ſo powerful as to be able to compaſs all his deſignes and that lawfully; yea and were ſecurely certain of the continuance of this power and good hap: I am perſwaded ſuch a one would enjoy les con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:39021:243"/> then another who followd his own fancy in nothing, but renounced it in all for the love of God. A certain contentive relliſh of the wil doth accompany its fulfilling: and there is no content nor complacence greater then that which God hath in the performance of his wil. If God ſhould communicate to thee one drop of that delight of his wil which he imparts to thoſe who only do and deſire his wil; thou wouldſt take incomparably more joy in a total denial of thy own, then if it were allwayes accompliſhed: for he that enjoyes his own wil hath only the joy of a humane wil: but if he renounce it to do the wil of God, he wil partake, mediating the grace of the divine goodnes, of the guſt of the divine wil. To be allwayes doing what one liſteth is eſteemd the height of humane fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; what wil it then be to do what God liſteth. Mans wil is impure, it is accompanied with anxiety and ſprinkled with the hyſop of unſavory contrarieties; the divine wil is moſt pure, and in a continual poſſeſsion of joy: Wil and pleaſure are one &amp; the ſelf ſame thing in God, wherefore he that hath the former muſt needs have the latter. In God appetite is not diſtinguiſhed from joy; in creatures it is much otherwiſe. In the elements motion to a place is one thing, and repoſe in a place another; in heaven they are all one: light &amp; heat in the fire are two things, in the ſun and ſtars the ſelf ſame: ſo mans wil and joy are things diſtinctly different, in God uniformly
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:39021:244"/> the ſame. Neyther can one ſafely place his joy els where but in the fulfilling of the divine wil and total renouncement of his own: for a man having then in wiſh and poſſeſſion the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, is ſo priviledgd that joy inſeparably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends him; for all falls out according to his harts deſire. Therfore it is no ſuch ſad buſines to ſtand at a defiance with his own wil, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poil himſelf of all propriety, and wholly deny himſelf in all. No body ſtands in ſuch an utter abnegation of this, nor dies ſo intirely to it, nor renounceth ſo fully all ſelf-intereſt as do the bleſſed in heaven, who are without the leaſt touch of willing or not willing: &amp; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles in ſuch a rigorous mortification of it they find a ſpecial guſt, and live moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly. Why then doſt thou refuſe to deny thy ſelf who ſeekſt ſalvation in that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven where there is the higheſt ſelf denial? train thy ſelf up to glory and relinquiſh thy ſelf. Perſwade thy ſelf that thou canſt not be happy there but by doing that which now thou eſteemſt a great unhappines. Goe to then and begin that, which if thou be ſaved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou ſhalt never ceaſe to proſecute. Do that at length, which, if thou comeſt to a ſtate of happines, thou ſhalt do for all eternity. In that endles perpetuity of bliſs thou ſhalt never ſeek thy own wil, being for ever and ever not only conforme to the divine but alſo transformd into it through the ardours of charity.</p>
                  <p>Who is there that being thirſty and having
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:39021:244"/> an earthen pot and it empty, had not rather have a golden one and full of ſome ſweet and refreſhing liquour? who is there that being ill at eaſe and having a crazd body, would not rather chuſe to have one ſound and robuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? who is there that being dul of capacity and doltiſh in conceiving things would not covet the intellect of an Angel, and to be as quick of comprehenſion as a Cherubin? O man, why wilt thou not exchange thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, fruſtrable, diſeaſd, fooliſh wil for the wil of God infruſtrable, joyful, and conſummated in happines? if thou deſireſt to underſtand as doth an Angel, which thou art not able to compaſs: why doſt thou not deſire to wil as God willeth, this being within thy reach? he that wil be alwayes in joy let him never ſeek it in himſelf nor to himſelf, yea he muſt extirpate all private and created love; otherwiſe whither ſoever he flyes, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goes about, he carryes lets and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances along with him, yea multiplies them; inſomuch that the further he flyes, and the more he undertakes, the more he is entangled, being les capable of the repoſe he ſeeks. Who goes once aſtray from the right path the further he goes the more he wanders: how much the more a man buſyeth himſelf in chuſing this or that in order to joy or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcency, the les ſhal he find it, becauſe he is in a greater exerciſe of ſelf wil, which is the cauſe of his diſquiet and trouble, and makes him ſtray further from the way of joy
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:39021:245"/> and repoſe. A ſparrow falling into a net, the more it ſtruggles to free it ſelf, the more it is entangled.</p>
                  <p>God is ſo good that an overplus of his goodnes remains for a more capacious wil then thine and all the Seraphins: why doſt thou then ſtrayten thy humane wil buſying it about thy ſelf, as if in half of it ſelf it could ſufficiently ſatisfy the divine goodnes? if God be to be loved, there is no room left neyther for ſelf love nor any thing els. Take, o Lord, my whole love take my whole wil: nor let me ſlip this happy exchange, by which for this my naughty one I may own thine the beſt of all others.</p>

A ſick perſon is not a little comforted if any one give him a viſit; and why doth not a ſick and miſcreant ſoul exult with joy that her God hath her continually in his eye &amp; providence. If a Prince caſt but once a favorable look upon his ſervant it rejoyceth him to his very hart; and I, o Lord, am nothing moved though thou never caſt thy eyes off me nor divert thy hands, being wholly taken up and buſyed in mercy towards me.

The queen of Saba made ſo many dayes journey to ſee the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Salomon and his court; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not thee, my God, though ſo nigh me as to ſejourn in my houſe.

                  <p>O how continually, o God, art thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in me, and yet I ſo little preſent to thee, and take ſo little notice of thee! thy eſſence penetrates each part of me much more intirely then the ſun beames penetrate each part and parcel of a tranſparent chriſtal, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly then our ſoul is diffuſed through our body. The preſential aſsiſtance of thy wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome provides for me and playes it ſelf the purveyer that nothing may be wanting, and if I do any good, that it may impart a reward: thou committeſt not this to the intercourſe of thy Angels only and their relation, but thou thy ſelf becomeſt my overſeer. Thy power carryes me in thy boſome as a nurſe or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therdoth her deareſt child: and becauſe theſe duties of being in me, of ſeing me, of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me in my being, are neceſſarily annexd to thy divinity, thou wouldſt have me engaged to thee, o good IESV, for a voluntary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and there being but one way wherein thou couldſt neceſſarily be abſent, thou didſt invent a meanes even in that to be alſo preſent in thy moſt holy body, that thou mighteſt be preſent with me both corporally and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. O ungrateful ſoul, why wilt thou

                  <p>Carry, o ſoul, reſpect to thy ſelf and the Altar of thy mind, where God dwels by grace, which thou perchance now partakeſt of, and woe be to thee if thou doſt not, the divinity being there communicated.

If Chriſt ſhould come viſibly to thee when thou art all alone in thy chamber, wouldſt thou in his preſence put thy ſelf in any les ſeemly poſture, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtand in a reverend, ſubmiſsive, compoſd manner, trembling at the aſpect of ſuch an awful majeſty?

The divinity is preſent not after one manner but many, by filling and ſurrounding thee with his boundles eſſence as the ocean doth a ſpunge; by carrying thee in the eye of his all ſeeing providence, by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining thee by his power, by cheriſhing, imbracing, and adopting thee for his child by his heavenly grace. O ſoul, why ſendeſt thou thy deſires, in ſo long a pilgrimage, ſince God is ſo nigh at hand; why doſt thou aſpire to other joyes he being preſent? thou haſt a ſpeedy redreſs for all thy miſeries, why art thou contriſtated? a refuge &amp; ſanctuary againſt all thy calamities is cloſe by; what needſt thou fear? let all thy affection ſpend it ſelf in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing and kiſsing this thy moſt loving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, in whoſe boſome thou art nurturd and brooded up. Conſider thy ſelf more neerly allyed to God then to thy brother, then to thy Father, then to thy mother: for the kindred and allyance betwixt thee and God is greater then betwixt a child and his parent. Let him then be allwayes preſent to thee who

                  <p>This preſence of God is the vital action of grace: a holy ſoul is ſo long in an actual and waking exerciſe of life as it loves God and is mindful of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether it be employd in the contemplation of his perfections, or ſeek actively to advance his greater glory. For as God is not only preſent to us by his eſſence &amp; knowledg, but alſo by his power and activity; ſo the beſt method of framing the preſence of God, is to conſider him playing the good Operarius, and directing his actions to our behoof. Who wil not become active on Gods behalf, ſince he works all in all for ours? but yet though a ſoul ſurceaſe from this, ſhe ſhal not therfore dye by ſin, but wil be like one that is a ſleep, not dead but yet ſcarſe alive, as not enjoying the uſe of life: ſo a ſoul that is in oblivion of her God though ſhe be not voyd of life yet ſhe is in ſo ſound a ſleep that ſhe reaps no benefit of her ſpiritual vitalityes. O how long-lifd wil one be that is ſtil mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of God! o how many ages wil he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, which even thoſe that otherwiſe are held ſpiritual do ordinarily forfeyt! this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God is alſo the ſenſe of grace; for without it the ſoul lyes like one in a palſey. The palſey is a diſeaſe not a death; but it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives ones limbs of all ſenſe and vital mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: life and grace are then to ſmal purpoſe
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:39021:248"/> when the memory of God is benumd and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtupifyed whether it be in action or contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
                  <p>One palm tree becomes fruitful merely at the preſence of another; and the ſoul at the preſence of God is loaden with all variety of fruit. Without the preſence of the ſun all is buryed in obſcurity, nothing doth partake of beauty; by the preſence of God a ſoul is illuſtrated and is made moſt comely to the eye. The elements cannot brook to be abſent from their center; and no les is a ſoul carried to her center of repoſe God. As a ſtone if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynd in the ayre keeps alwayes a propenſion to the earth, and if it be left to it ſelf tends thither without any more adoe; ſo a ſoul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured upon God, even when it is detaind from its repoſe, by reaſon of occurrent duties eyther of life or ſtate of life, even in that kind of violence, it breaths with tacit but connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſpirations after God: and theſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being ended and ſhe left to her ſelf, ſhe haſtens to her center, recollecting her ſelf in her cloſeſt retreats with God, that to her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſhe may become like the Angels who ſee allwayes the face of their Father, and covet to ſee it more and more: which deſire ought to be as connatural and recreative to our harts as is the ayre in which they breath.</p>

Thou accoſteſt me in each creature that thou maiſt beg it by them all; dividing out thy love in ſo many wayes
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:39021:249"/> to gain mine. What window ſoever I open thou as a ſuiter occurreſt to my eyes ſtanding behind the wall, looking through the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, looking forth through the grates. If I ſee, if I hear, if I ſmel, if I taſt, lo, thy lovely face preſents it ſelf, thy ſweet voyce, the odour of my God, a honey comb with its honey is forthwith at hand; every where ſuit is made for love. If fower or five grave men ſhould avouch any thing, or invite others to an enterprize, each one would doe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they ſaid: why give not I eare to ſo many creatures while they all invite me to the love of my God? ſince he hath ſo many vouchers of his comelines why am I ſo back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in belief? if men allurd with the beauty of things thought them endowed with a dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; how much art thou, the ſoveraign and aggregate of all beauties more beautiful then them? for thou being the ſource and author of it al I, thou allotteſt to each one the pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it hath.</p>
                  <p>All creatures repreſent thy love and beauty with ſilent cryes, and inviſible colours, but what voyce or pourtraiture wil bring us to thy knowledg? creatures are not able to paint thee forth. All the perfections they contain ſeem nothing elſe but ſo many blemiſhes. Who art thou then, or where, o my beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully faire? who though thou be every where preſent with me, yet I find thee no where; and though thou comprizeſt all, yet thou art none of that all. Creatures object
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:39021:249"/> themſelves to my view as if they carried a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of thee, but I look upon them as a riddle. Thou art not that, o Lord, which they delineate thee to be; who though they tel not a plain lye, yet they chalk thee ſo forth, that thou art not truly what they repreſent. In this manner I ſought whom my ſoul loveth: I ſought him but found him not. I wil riſe and make a turn about the citty, through the lanes of nature &amp; the ſtreets of the heavens, I enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the formes of creatures, of the conſorts of muſique, of the fragrancy of parfumes, the taſts of inebriating relliſhes, the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cements of lovers; and they all ſaid we are not thy beloved: he ſhines in ſuch ſort that no place is capable of his ſplendour, he ſends forth a ſound but ſuch a one as no wind doth carry a long: he yealds a ſent, but ſo as that no ayre diſperſeth it; he gives ſuch a relliſh that no hunger can bite upon it; he is ſo inherent that no ſatiety can cauſe a ſeparation. I enquired of the earth, and it made anſwer I am not he; if the heavens of beavens do not contain him, why art thou ſo inquiſitive of me? I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quird of the ſea, and it trembling ſaid I am not; his abyſs much exceeds mine, and it is no wayes to be waded through. I enquird of heaven, and it ſaid I am not thy God; he mounts much above my ſphere. If none of all you creatures be he, tel me where I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ydings of him? the watchful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences and guardian ſpirits of this world made reply; he made us ſeek him above us.
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:39021:250"/> When I had paſſed a litle beyond them I found the beloved of my ſoul, whom I could not find among creatures. In this reſpect only I behold and find thee, o light placed in the midſt of lights, that I am able neyther to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold nor find thee: for how can I comprehend what is incomprehenſible? fly fly my beloved: in this reſpect I wil comprehend thee becauſe thou flieſt me: I know ſo much the more of thee the more I know thee not to be knowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and I approach nigher to thy knowledg, the more thou recedeſt from my comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I ſought in my bed and the retirednes of my ſolitude night by night the beloved of my ſoul. The ſplendour of things beautiful in reſpect of thee is a night: the ſeemlines of the heavens is a night: the very beauty of the ſun, its refulgency, and any other, I wil not ſay, created but falſly imaginable comelines is a night. If each ſtar were more reſplendent then the ſun, and the ſun himſelf did by as many degrees exceed theſe ſtars as there are ſands of the ſea and motes illuſtrated by the ſun, he would be an eye ſore in reſpect of thee, nor would be more conſpicuous then the ſtars now are in preſence of the ſun.</p>
                  <p>But to what purpoſe do I bring theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed beauties of viſible things, theſe ruſtick forms even of the ſun, &amp; moriſh lights. Let us draw into reſemblance theſe ſpiritual and candid ones, whoſe lovelines is ſuch, that an Angel appearing to the devout Father Iohn Fernandez of our ſociety, the ſight ſo affected
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:39021:250"/> him that he fainted through exceſs of joy, &amp; was not able to ſupport himſelf: affirming that all the beauties of this world were but blemiſhes and deformities in regard of this. Imagin then that the comelines of that Angel were as much greater then it is, as there are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>omes in the aire, and that each Angel were endowed with ſuch comelines; &amp; there being millions of millions of them, or in a manner a number numberles, ſum up all this comelines of them all into one; it would be ill-favourd and ugly in compariſon of the beauty of God, and I ſay not would ſeem a mote, but a mere nothing. O my hart why art thou not extaſied with ſuch amiablenes, and ſet on fire with ſuch an abyſs of light? o my hart thy hardnes and heavines is greater then one of iron, if this immenſe loadſtone of love do not elevate and attract it.</p>
                  <p>But art thou perchance, o Lord, that clarity and ſeemlines which I conceit, in regard of which, ſo great light of the ſun or an Angel multiplied to ſuch an infinity ſeems no more then darknes? no; but thou art infinitly ſeemlier: nor after ſo great light do I ſee thee, though thou be moſt refulgent. I only know that that refulgency is not thee, becauſe compared to thee it is darknes: but what a one thou art is wholly unknown to me, thy light dazlingly blinding me: and the brighter it ſhines it leaves me in greater darknes: But I never behold thee more clearly then in this miſt; nor do I find true day, that is, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:39021:251"/> of dayes, but in this night at noon day; clear to me by reaſon of its obſcurity and mid night. O eternal love, take now my hartand all my love. But why do I ſay take it, if thou haſt forcibly ſiezd it: why commandſt thou me to give thee my hart, if thou haſt already robd me of it; not in one hair or one eye of thine, but in my blindnes and the hair-braindnes of my extravagancies. Thou haſt robd me, becauſe ſo great thou art that I cannot diſcerne thee: thou haſt robd me, becauſe though I ſo contemptibly dwarfiſh, have offended thee, thou ſo majeſtically great covetteſt to be loved by me. But thou, o Lord, who haſt wounded my hart with thy goodnes, muſt out of the ſame, power into it the oyl of thy mercy, that it may be a healing ſalue to the wounds of my ſins.</p>
                  <p>O hidden God, if thou, even in this ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of thee, be pleaſing to me above all I know; what wilt thou be when I ſhal know thee intuitively and face to face in thy clear ſun ſhine. Sieze and diſpoil me of my hart; take all my wil &amp; never reſtore it to me again; permit not a knife to be in the hands of a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but reſerve to thy ſelf mannagement of it, for what remains for me in heaven, or what do I covet beſides thee on earth. I rejoice that my hart faileth me, becauſe thou haſt taken it from me. Let my hart be alwaies upon thee becauſe my treaſure is placed in thee. O truly God of my hart, becauſe now thou art Lord of it! but becauſe thou art mine, though
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:39021:251"/> my hart hath faild me, yet a better then mine wil not: thou wilt ſupply its room: thou o God, art my hart, thou art that part which hath faild me. To witt, thou ſhalt be my hart eternally; &amp; therfore ſupply for the functions of my hart, Thou canſt actuate my wil for me, &amp; provide what thou knoweſt expedient in my behalf: it ſhal only be my task and emploiment to love thee. Thou ſhalt love me inſteed of my ſelf, that all my love may be wholly beſtowed on thee, in ſuch wife that ſelf love may no way impede me. O happy loſs of my hart, if God ſupply in lieu of it!</p>

<pb n="470" facs="tcp:39021:252"/> how radiant wil the light of thy Trinity be which cannot be ſhadowed? O moſt light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome darknes when ſome clarity of ſuch a myſtery is communicated to a ſoul! that light is an abſcurity becauſe a ſoul ſees not it ſelf but is loſt as in a maze. Like as one that walk: in darknes &amp; knowes not where he is; ſo the mind ſurprizd in that light is ignorant what becomes of it ſelf: and having regaind it ſelf in that brightnes (which muſt needs be ſo, it being in God) there it looſeth it ſelf becauſe it finds God which happens when being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred from the traffique of inferiour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and becoming conforme to Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyd by a conſtant mortification and crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of its wil, it fixeth an undazled eye and humble mind upon the ſtupendious ſecret of the Trinity; there it relliſheth life in its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal purity as in its fountain: there it admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res the nature of a moſt ſimple ſimplicity in all points conſonant with a Trinity.</p>
                  <p>When we know any thing worth our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: we are touchd with a pleaſing deſire of beholding it. What more admirable, and conſequently more pleaſing then to know that moſt ſimple unity into which the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Perſons combines it ſelf; as alſo that Trinity which a moſt ſimple ſimplicity doth not deſtroy? Vnity doth ſhine diſtinctly in the Trinity; the Trinity, for as much as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, to what's within, is conſpicuous in Vnity. The Father is the ſource of the Son: the Son iſſues from the Father according to
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:39021:252"/> the diſtinction of a Perſon, and remaines in him according to the unity of Eſſence: from the Father &amp; the Son proceeds the H. Ghoſt, and his ſubſtance remaines both in Father and Son: where a Trinity hinders not Vnity, nor Vnity impedes Trinity: yea where Trinity furthers Vnity, and Vnity favours Trinity. Therfore God is more one becauſe he is alſo three.</p>
                  <p>What more pleaſing then to ſee thoſe things mutually conſpiring, which ſeem repugnant to one another? There would not be in God the greateſt ſimplicity imaginable unles there were the greateſt efficacy: there would not be the greateſt efficacy unles there were a Trinity of Perſons; there would not be a Trinity of Perſons unles there were an Vnity of Eſſence. The divine ſimplicity is ſo far from obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Trinity that both Trinity contributes to unity, and a moſt united Vnity requires a Trinity. Therfore the more ſimple God is in his nature the more is he triplifyd in Perſons: and as no greater ſimplicity is conceptible then that of the Divine nature; ſo there can be no truer diſtinction then that of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in that Vnity. The more things partake of ſimplicity and purity, the more efficacious they are according to the tenet of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. Becauſe fire ſhares more eminently of theſe two qualities, it is the moſt active a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the elements; and upon this ſcore the heavens more then ſublunary natures, and ſpirits then bodies. Vertue the more it is
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:39021:253"/> united and condenſd the more forcible it is in its operations: and the more ſimple a thing is the more it hath of the forme, which is both its act and activity: now in an infinite ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which is a moſt pure act, and a forme the ſimpleſt of all others, as being moſt refind and remote from matter, there muſt needs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede an infinite efficacy in the production of an infinite Perſon by the communication of an infinite ſubſtance from all eternity. My ſoul ſtands amazd while it contemplates this ſimplicity, and tranſported out of its ſelf it adores this divine perfection in the equality &amp; eternity of the Perſons: for the more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple things are, as they are more effectual, ſo are they alſo more perfect in themſelves. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is not taken from the matter but the forme: wherfore the more any thing partakes of the forme, the more it alſo partakes of perfection; and by conſequence being the ſimpler things are the more they have of the forme, the more alſo they have of perfection: and for this reaſon Angels are more perfect then ſenſitive creatures. Seing then that the greateſt ſimplicity is the chiefeſt, ſole, and total forme or act, it muſt by good ſequele be the moſt perfect: wherefore the Son of God is equal and Coeternal to his Father by reaſon of the immenſe ſimplicity of the divine nature. Among men the Father is greater then the Son, becauſe to make a creature ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of engendring it is requiſite that he be in a perfect ſtate: and ſince God from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:39021:253"/> is immenſly ſimple, he is from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity perfect, and conſequently from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity generating, and the Father is not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Son. Among men no body is born a Father: God from all eternity is Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor was he ſooner God then a Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Among men it is highly prizd if the Son pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced carry a reſemblance with his Father in the lineaments and features of his face; and that child which moſt reſembles him is moſt in his love: what a fecundity doth it intimate where the Son is produced not only like in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents but the ſame in ſubſtance? how great a ſubject of love where the Son ſo reſembles his Father, that the Father is not liker him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor more himſelf; and after ſo great ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude the Son is only one, and begotten by him without intermixture: where the Father is a Virgin and begets him a Virgin, and the Son not an infant, and born without a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? wherfore the Son doth not leſſen affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as dividing it with a Mother, there being none here, nor the Father with a ſpouſe. But the Father loves intimately his only Son, &amp; the Son loves intimately his only Parent. Where the Son is not begotten of a particle of his Father but of his whole paternal ſubſtance: &amp; whatſoever the Father, beholds in his Son is own &amp; of himſelf; &amp; whatſoever the Son be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beholds in his Father, he knowes him to have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated without envy or partiality. How can they chuſe but infinitly love one another, they being ſo infinitly one? while theſe and
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:39021:254"/> ſuch like are after an ineffable but intelligible manner, by a profound ſilence thunderd forth to a ſoul and are made apparent to it; how can it chuſe but be all ſet on fire, when in ſo great light and with all its powers it ſhal be enamoured upon that ſupereſſential and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent perfection of Vnity and Trinity, challenging all the Angels and Seraphins in that ſmoak which repleniſheth the houſe ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this furnace of ardent charity; and crying Holy, Holy, Holy, flying thither with the ſpread wings of its hart, partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerating this heat of love and partly raiſing new flames?</p>
                  <p>But there chiefly it remaines like one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſied, wholly inebriated with divine love, when it conſiders that Ocean of goodnes wherwith an infinite nature is communicated to the Son, and thoſe ardours of love in which is made the Proceſsion of the H. Ghoſt. Here a created Spirit is at a non-plus, and through exceſs of affection periſheth as it were in it ſelf, becoming a prey both to fire and water: it is drownd in an Ocean of ſo great goodnes, it burnes in the pile of that ſtupendious love. Nothing can be imagined more efficacious to convince and attract our harts to a pure and ſincere love of God then that inconceptible goodnes wherewith the Father communicates himſelf to the Son and both of them to the H. Ghoſt. Nothing can be imagined more devoutly, more tenderly, more ſweetly affecting, then that out-burſt

For if it be goodnes in it ſelf which is allective, and the booty which wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderd love preys upon, that towards which the wil is carried with all the poyze of its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, what greater goodnes imaginable then that the infinite goodnes it ſelf which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of good is diffuſive, communicate not a part but all it ſelf entirely, not only what it hath but alſo what it is. This proſutenes of communication is a greater ſubject of admiration then any other infinite perfection of the divine nature.

The divine nature is an object of wonder; but wil not this ſeem a greater wonder, that it ſhould be gratis beſtowd upon the Son by that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable communication; and yet a greater then this, that it ſhould be done after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ſtil to remain in the giver. Beſides if love be an argument of goodnes (for diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and communication never proceed but from love) where can greater love be imagind then where all that is, is love. Love ſeeks equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the lover and beloved; and here is ſo
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:39021:255"/> great love, that the parties beloved carry not only a ſimilitude but even an identity betwixt them, in ſo much that both their loves are one and the ſelf-ſame. From whence neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily followes the greateſt fidelity and joy conceptible, ſince they cannot chuſe but love and be beloved equally. This their love is ſo efficacious and legitimate that though the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son were not by their eternal ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration one &amp; the ſame nature, the H. Ghoſt would make them ſuch. This is the aym of charity, this is the function of love, to make the lover and beloved one, and ſince that love is of a God moſt infinitly perfect towards him that is alſo God, it muſt needs be moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe and wholly efficacious. But if it wrought not an Vnity it would not be altogether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but like the love of a thing limited and towards a thing limited, not towards an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit only begotten, equal to his infinit Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; where both the lover and beloved are infinite. Where there is ſuch an excellent and genuine love how much goodnes muſt needs intercede? ſo that the Trinity is a moſt preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant argument of an infinite good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of a divine perfection, (that being good which is perfect) as alſo of Gods ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: wherfore the Trinity of Perſons is an authentical teſtimony of the divine Vnity. What complacence doth a ſoul take in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this! not as I have rudely explicated it, or as it can be explicated; for this is only felt by an inexplicable manner: for as there are no
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:39021:255"/> natural ſpecies which can bring us to this knowledg, ſo neyther are there words ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly expreſsive of what is manifeſted to ſome pious ſoules concerning the word eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Therfore the ſoul of a creature is ſo over joyd when the mutual proportion and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the increated Trinity and Vnity, and the neceſsity of both to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the divine perfection, is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to it, that it is all in jubily and exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tranſported beſides it ſelf, and quite ſpent through amorous deſires and the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhments of true charity, thirſting earneſtly to diſcover in the other life this ſtupendious goodnes of the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>Why longſt thou, o my ſoul, to ſee any thing elſe beſides this great ſpectacle of the world, for whoſe ſight alone the Seraphins and all the Hierarchies of Angels and Saints were created, and introduced into heaven, as ſo many ſpectatours. Where is thy curioſity? where thy deſire of knowledg, if thou covet not to be diſſolved and contemplate that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery and to dive into this hidden ſecret? but thy longing muſt remit thee to the other life, and not put thee upon inquiry in this, how he is three and one. Thou muſt not ſearch the cauſe why he is ſo, ſince thou art not able to give the cauſe of what he is. Thou ſeekſt in vain a cauſe in him who hath no cauſe. God were not to be ſtiled great, if he were not greater then our capacity. Thou muſt not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nquire after what manner he can be ſo, who
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:39021:256"/> never could be before he was ſo. Philoſophers could never ſufficiently penetrate into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of divers wormes, and no body knowes himſelf throughly, how then canſt thou hope to make a ful diſcovery of the divine nature, thy Author? wherfore thou muſt captivate thy reaſon to the ſimplicity of faith in this ſupernatural myſtery: for that perſpicuity which the divine indulgence daignes ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to inſinuate belongs not to all; but only to whom God calls out of the number of thoſe who dwel with his Son in the mount Calvary, and in a totall ejurement of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: who denying ſelf wil have taken up their croſs &amp; followed IESVS to that mount, and wil have them follow him thence to the mount Olivet &amp; glory: thoſe he priviled geth ſomtimes in ſuch ſort as to make them parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his majeſty. Where I am ſaith IESVS there alſo ſhal my ſervant be. He that ſhal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with Chriſt in ſuffering ſhal alſo partake of this extraordinary light and joy. So when our Holy Patriarch Saint Ignatius had waſted &amp; exhauſted himſelf with corporal pennances and auſterities, it was more copiouſly and clearly imparted to him then one is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. So that mirrour of fervour F. Didacus Martinus did almoſt allwayes behold himſelf environed with a glorious light of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or ſome one of the three Perſons. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheles it appertains to all to covet with moſt ardent deſires the ſight of this ancient and eternal novelty in the life to come. It was
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:39021:256"/> reveald to that holy ſervant of God F. Iohn Fernandius that a certain religious man of our ſociety was long detaind in purgatory, becauſe he had omitted to wiſh with ardency the ſight of the moſt B. Trinity. O my ſoul, why art not thou more enamoured upon the ſight of this theatre of the bleſſed, to whoſe ſpectacle all minds are ſummond, allrational creatures are invited?</p>
                  <p>What a joy wil it be to behold that which now by reaſon of the narrownes of our thoughts or ignorance, through an exceſs of jubily and love we are not able to comprize? how exultingly ſhall we rejoice while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template theſe firſt fruits of the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that fore-taſt and new expreſſion of the divine goodnes where it communicates it ſelf to the Son, and that primitive bounty of God? what a pledg and aſſurance wil a ſoul receive of the divine benignity towards it ſelf, when it beholds this profuſenes of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? if God without deliberation gave all that he is, wil he not by the adviſe and vote of his goodnes grant that we may at leaſt ſee what he is? if he permit us not to be what he is, he wil permit us to admire what he is: if not to poſſeſs him, at leaſt to enjoy him: if not to live by the ſame life, at leaſt by ſuch another, and that eternal, of which a ſoul hath a pawn when it beholds a generation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding death.
